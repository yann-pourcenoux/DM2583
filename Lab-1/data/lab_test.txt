4682832,"A chance meeting on a train changes the life of tennis player Guy Haines (Farley Granger) in ways he never could have imagined.  When an odd, obsessed tennis fan, Bruno Anthony (Robert Walker), recognizes Haines, he does his best to ingratiate himself, talking incessantly about the details of Guy's life, details that most people wouldn't bring up at first meeting.  But Bruno is a strange man indeed.  Bruno hates his father and wants him dead.  Guy wants a divorce from his unfaithful wife Miriam so he can marry political socialite Ann Morton (Ruth Roman).  Bruno devises a plan where he and Guy swap or exchange murders:  Guy murders Bruno's father and Bruno murders Guy's wife.  By doing so, it will be impossible to link either of them to the respective murders.  Bruno thinks this is the perfect plan and convinces, he thinks, Guy that this plan will work.  Guy on the other hand is half listening to his odd companion and assumes that nothing will come of Bruno's wild imaginings.  Wrong!  Bruno actually kills Guy's wife, then hunts Guy down to have him return the favor. Guy is shocked but fearful that if he doesn't humor Bruno, he will be implicated in his wife's murder.  As with all Hitchcock films, there are enough plot twists to keep the viewer guessing what the outcome will be right up to the famous carousel scene toward the film's climax.  Hitchcock, of course, employs excellent camera work, with great scenes in Washington, D.C. (the scene with Walker in front of the Jefferson Memorial is absolutely chilling) and the Forest Hills Tennis Club on Long Island, where we are treated to what a tennis match looked like in the 1950s.  Like Shadow of a Doubt, Hitchcock's earlier classic, doubles abound.  The two men, one good, one evil, Guy is going to Southampton (Long Island) to play doubles, two drinks on the train (doubles), two women with glasses, Miriam and Barbara Morton (Ann's younger sister), and on and on.  Based on the novel by Patricia Highsmith (The Talented Mister Ripley) adapted by Ben Hecht (uncredited), and Alfred and Alma Hitchcock.  Raymond Chandler gets credit for the screenplay, however, most of what he originally wrote did not make the final cut.  Once this movie gets going, the suspense and tension just doesn't let up.  This film provided probably the best roles either Granger or Walker ever had, and they do excellent work here.  Walker is effectively charming and creepy all at the same time (like Joseph Cotton in Shadow of a Doubt), and Granger is properly shocked and paralyzed by what he perceives to be an impossible series of events placing him and his fiancee in incredible peril.  The British version has a different ending than the American version (I prefer the ending in the American version to the British), however, both are satisfying and don't change the film's conclusion.  A wonderful film with all the great Hitchcock touches; you will be wonderfully entertained by Strangers on a Train.", 5.0
7367248,"Although I bought this box set only a week or two after I decided that I was a Beatles fan, I am so glad that it was my first in-depth look at the Beatles. It took me less than a week to watch because I was glued to the television, watching eleven hours of footage. There were concerts, interviews with the three remaining Beatles at the time, music videos, clips from their wonderful movies, and oh so much more. Anyone that is a Beatles fan AT ALL would LOVE this set!!! If you are considering buying it, stop considering! Buy it right away!

2123465,"""Shaun"" is supposed to be a comedic 'spoof' and a 'homage' to ""The Zombie Movie"".  It accomplished that and more.  While the comedy is wryly British, it is still funny - and the social comment is Universal to civilized society (in cased you missed it - we're all zombies already).<br /><br />Just a fun movie, from start to finish - BE WARNED there are the gratuitous 'gore' scenes necessary for it to BE a Zombie film, but they are few, fast and over.  There is a lot of 'quick-wit' humor - The Newscaster's comments  at the end, ""I never thought I'd say..."" as an example.<br /><br />Strip away the humor and homage, and there is actually a much tighter plot than many movies.  There are not many loose threads - ""How did the zombie get in?"" - go back three scenes and oh, Ed habitually leaves the front door open...  Impressed by the attention to those kind of details.<br /><br />It's billed as a ""Romantic Comedy with Zombies"" - and it delivers.", 4.0
5680543,"Bought this set for my husband's birthday.  We'd never really been able to get into the show while it ran; but having the complete series - great idea!<br /><br />Content: SG-1 is just great!  Characters, plots, even an occasional effect :)<br /><br />Product:  First order - lots of scratched disks.  Several unplayable, plenty of skipping and popping.  Second order - just like first order.  3 disks either totally or partially unplayable in first 5 seasons.  Didn't bother checking rest.  Returned :(  This production quality is REALLY unacceptable IMO.  I don't CARE much about the price - having unplayable disks repeatedly points to a problem SOMEWHERE in the mfg or delivery chain.<br /><br />Amazon's Response / Support: First time issued replacements even though outside the 30 day window.  Second time: issued RMA and full refund.  This was absolutely the right service response and my happiness with Amazon went up several notches.  I may never buy another complete series boxed set without waiting and researching; but I'll be back to Amazon if only for the great service.<br /><br />Now, how will we get our fix for the last 5 seasons :(  Netflix ?", 1.0
3051578,"This is an old film, but I've only recently seen it.<br /><br />It's about a woman's struggle in the workplace, a very eighties theme, if you're old enough to remember it. I found that aspect of it well-done.  The setting is the iron fields of the upper midwest. Many of the players seem to be amateurs, which is a source of its charm, in many ways. The small town setting and culture as depicted create an effective ambiance.<br /><br />But it's also a love story, and I did not find it a very compelling one in terms of the chemistry between the lovers.  Lisa Eichhorn as June has pretty eyes, but she's too stoic to be interesting.  Tom Bowers as her lover is too old for her and just as big a jerk as her antagonists for much of the picture.  Steve Yokam as the evil ex-husband gets to do the most acting and appoints himself well.<br /><br />The music is pleasingly haunting in places.<br /><br />But the best thing about this movie is the scenery -- the countryside, Lake Superior, and the lovely Cinda Jackson as Karen, June's best friend.", 4.0
7838376,"A motion picture following in the not-so-illustrious filmmaking footsteps of such feature-length propaganda films as &quot;John Q&quot; and &quot;The Life of David Gale&quot;, &quot;Runaway Jury&quot; was doomed to well-deserved obscurity by its awful script before the first scene was shot.<br />  I went into this movie with rather high expectations.  Though I have no love for John Grisham, I am very fond of John Cusack's work.  Unfortunately, not even his solid perfomance could save this movie.<br />  &quot;Runaway Jury&quot; suffers from a complete lack of originality (even after the producers changed the legal target of this film from big tobacco to gun control; presumably to avoid having to be compared with &quot;The Insider&quot;).  Most average moviegoers will see the predictable plot &quot;twists&quot; a mile away.<br />  The plot and most of the characters (especially Gene Hackman's) become so farfetched that this movie might as well take place on the Starship Enterprise.  Still, even with the fantastic, the movie manages to drag on... and on... and on during its considerable middle stages. I started to wonder if it would ever end.<br />  Mercifully it did, and came to a &quot;climax&quot; so predictable and so (there's no other way to say this): Hollywood, that I was left with the intense feeling that I would have been better intellectually served by watching Pokemon.<br />  The agenda of the producers is so painfully clear throughout the movie that the characters might as well have been wearing sandwich boards spouting anti-gun slogans.  Even supporters of gun-control will be turned off by the constant self-serving nature of this picture, and offended by the lack of subtlety in which the writers have chosen to deliver the message.  They really do think we're stupid.<br />  Oh, and John Cusack, homey, this is strike two after &quot;Identity&quot;.  Maybe you can get back with Steven Frears and JB and do a sequel to &quot;High Fidelity&quot; for redemption.  I just hope you got paid an awful lot to do this movie and didn't sign on because you liked the script.", 2.0

This movie prompted me to start reading his work.  I started with ""A Walk..."" the book.  And even though it's a lot different from the book, I appriciate both for being great stories.  Both of them are good stories, and I think the adaptation of this one rings true to the book.  They are different time settings - the book and the novel - but most of what Nicholas wrote stays with the movie.  You'll be blown away by Shane West and Mandy Moore.

2580489,"The Searchers is not your ""typical"" John Wayne Western. Sure - it is a cowboy movie that is directed by John Ford, and includes a simple story to follow. After the murder and kidnapping of a family member, the Duke and his buddy go searching for the culprits. In this case, a group of Indians led by a chief named Scar are to blame. But, the Searchers is different because John Wayne is much more intense in this role than others. Despite some slow parts in the plot, the Duke pulls off the role with vigor. Also, a few social issues are included as well.<br /><br />Normally I would give this movie five stars, but I simply did not enjoy it as much as some other John Wayne westerns that I have seen. While I think it is worth watching, not sure it is not quite a five-star classic. If you like Westerns, you will most likely enjoy this one. Although be prepared for a different type character than the Duke typically portrays.", 4.0
385106,"A well done portrayal of a pivotal time in the history of the United States. American Pastime reveals a portion of what life was like for the Japanese-Americans incarcerated in Relocation Camps. Tasteful in showing the hardships and challenges that faced families living in camps, it was true that for some, baseball and other sports are what saved their sanity. Also accurate is the fact that there were some people from Hawai'i that were sent to Topaz, the prejudice they faced, and the heavy loss of life suffered by the Go For Broke 442nd.<br /><br />I was one of the extras in this movie and having done a three-year project developing lesson plans on Topaz for the Japanese-American National Museum, I can tell you that the director and producer were careful to remain as true to details as possible.

They said the set was so well-done that if they didn't know better, they would have thought they were back in camp again.", 4.0

6274464,"Cast Away is the story of Chuck (Tom Hanks), a FedEx delivery worker who finds himself stranded on a desert island after his plane goes down.  On each end of the movie is the story of his life back in the ""real world""; however, that story is somewhat undeveloped and underemphasized.  Before the crash he had just proposed to his fiance, and upon his return he finds that she is married with children (and on a side note, either time moved faster on the mainland or else his loving fiance was married and pregnant in less than a year after his disappearance).  I felt that subplot should have either been left alone or else dealt with in a more elaborate way; the ending left the movie feeling incomplete.<p>However, the heart of the movie involves Chuck's time on the island, and it is simply Hanks at his best.  Chuck is alone, trying to survive; every little task could mean the difference between life and death.  For Hanks, this means he must display the gamut of emotions about seemingly trivial matters with no other actors to help with the illusion.  I know of no other actor that could have me to the point of tears when a volleyball starts to float away from him.  No offense to Russel Crowe, but how he won Best Actor for playing a stoic, monosyllabic gladiator over this performance is one of life's great mysteries.  For fans of great acting performances, this one is highly recommended.", 4.0
7670653,"Occasionally the passage of time makes clear that a work of art was not what it appeared to be at first.  What once seemed odd, out of place, or just plain wacked, then becomes a prescient work of art that is honored as being ahead of its time, or at least ahead of the audience's understanding of it.  ""Edward Scissorhands"" is such a film.<br /><br />Or, maybe it's just me.<br /><br />I recall seeing this unique fantasy/fairy tale a few years ago, but didn't get to see the whole thing.  I don't recall if I was distracted, just didn't have the time, or simply didn't get it, but upon close attention at long last I find this to be a mesmerizing, beautiful, touching film that defies categorization.  This singular vision of director Tim Burton, his fourth hit in a row following ""Pee-wee's Big Adventure,"" ""Beetle Juice,"" and ""Batman,"" is a retelling of the Frankenstein legend, with the twist that this manmade man was left with scissors instead of hands because his inventor, ""who invented a man,"" died just at the moment he was about to replace those monstrous hands with more human-looking ones.<br /><br />Johnny Depp plays Edward, of course, with pancake makeup, an electric hairdo, and a sense of Little Boy Lost that the women in the film can't resist, the chief of whom is eventually young and beautiful Winona Rider in her natural blonde (yes, her usual black hair is a dye job).  The fantasy element of the film allows us to overlook its anachronistic nature, as Edward is adopted by an Avon lady who lives in a neighborhood straight out of Jackie O's early to mid '60s suburbia yet one of its inhabitants talks about needing a new CD player.  We also see his home and its extremely modern security system.  And little details like, what did Edward eat for all those years when he was helpless and living alone and apart from the world, and why in heaven's name was he given scissors for hands in the first place?<br /><br />These are bothersome things, but the whole film is so unreal that they somehow don't intrude enough to mar either the atmosphere or the story.  It's a fairy tale, after all; questions of such nature are not welcome or required.<br /><br />Burton belongs to that pantheon of directors whose work bears a unique stamp, visually and aesthetically otherwise, so that it's clear that you're watching a Burton film.  That puts him in an elite group of directors, such as Hitchcock, Spielberg, Kubrick, Scorsese, Bergman, Tarantino, Fellini, Spike Lee, Sidney Lumet, David Lynch, Woody Allen, Robert Altman, etc., not bad company to be in.  ""Scissorhands"" reeks of Burton's rich textures of visuals and sounds that are slightly off yet perfectly interwoven, matching the story and the angle he wants to take with it.<br /><br />It also carries the delicious depth of story that one has to plumb after viewing.  Is the title character a representation of Burton himself, the self-image of a freakish character out of step with his surroundings and ultimately rejected to create his beautiful works of art without being judged by ""normal people""?  Is the film Burton's way of saying that he thinks God is dead, and that He left us incomplete, with the ability to create wondrous things but also the clumsiness that leads to horrible accidents that we are sometimes blamed for except by those we love?<br /><br />Perhaps both.  In any event, this is well worth repeated viewing.<br /><br />A couple of nits to clear up here:  Other reviewers make the mistake of saying this was Burton's first film (way wrong) and that this was Depp's first film (again way wrong).  Burton's earlier successes are detailed above.  Deep had been featured in ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" and ""Platoon"" before he became a star on TV's ""21 Jump Street,"" and he was the lead actor in the film ""Cry Baby"" before this film came out.  Just a note added in the cause of correct information.", 5.0
4744376,"Let's see... a guy in a bubble in space with a tree in it eats part of the tree and breaks out of the bubble - wait, that happened at the end. The guy has a dying wife (who is infinitely stoic about dying) who writes a book (called ""The Fountain"") that the guy starts reading. She wants him to finish the book for her, as she has written all but the last chapter (this is supposed to be really meaningful, because, she's dying, you know.) In it, a conquistador is sent by the queen of Spain to find a hidden Mayan pyramid that has the tree of immortality in it, using three holes in a broken knife for a map. She wants him to do this to save her from the Spanish Inquisition, which nobody expects. Once there, he fights his way through a few warriors and some kind of religious looking person, eats some of that tree, but instead of it saving him, it kills him and turns him into a bunch of flowers within a minute or so. What else... The guy is some type of medical researcher who violates all the rules about drug studies and, in a flash of insight caused by looking at patterns in falling snow (I think), miraculously comes up with a serum that reverses aging. He wanted to use it on his dying wife, but she had already died. [Heavy sigh.] He did save a dying monkey, though, so that's good. Then, back in space, he breaks out of the bubble, then goes back in. I think that's about it. He never finishes the book - they kind of forgot about it, I guess.<br />To those who compare this to 2001: A Space Odyssey - yes, there is a bubble in space in both movies. Otherwise, they bear no resemblance to each other whatsoever. To compare this to anything Kubrick made is an insult to Kubrick.<br />If you are the kind of person that thinks it is Philosophically Deep to see a bald guy in the lotus position tumbling through space or floating four feet off the ground in front a vaguely Mayan religious person, then you might have a chance of enjoying this movie. Otherwise, be prepared to feel like you just wasted 92 minutes of your life. Just awful.", 1.0

2169382,"This is a terrific movie.  I found it totally captivating as did my twelve year old son.  The title has a double meaning:  it refers to the month of March when the mating cycle of the Emperor Penguins begins and also to the long march this particular colony has to make to their mating ground.  Why do they have to travel such a distance to their colony?  Well, first you have to understand that this movie is about ONE colony, there are dozens of them all around the coat of Antarctica (I did some reading after the movie).  The cycle of mating, nurturing the egg, and raising the chick, takes months and months.  It begins in their fall (our spring) through their winter, spring, and into their summer.  During the spring and summer the ice melts towards their breeding ground.  They have to be at a place that remains safe for their chicks and in the summer the sea is only a few hundred yards from their breeding ground (which is convenient for the feeding of the always hungry and rapidly growing chick).<br /><br />The story of the way the couples choose each other, create and care for the fertilized egg, and that it requires both the male and female penguin and demands on them almost to the point of death is just amazing and strangely inspiring.  I guess because raising our young for more than twenty years requires a similar kind of dedication, but not as concentrated as the penguin couple's absolute focus over one brief season.<br /><br />The DCD also has a full length program on the making of the movie.  This is as fascinating as the movie in its own way.  The French filmmakers provide their own narration and at times their prose gets a bit much about how much they are sacrificing and so one.  While I take my hat off to them for giving a year in such awful conditions to get the footage, they did choose to do it.  But this documentary on the making of the film provides extra footage of the penguins that couldn't be in the G-rated version of the film and we get to see what they had to go through to get some of the amazing shots we see in the film.<br /><br />There is also a short program from National Geographic on the Emperor Penguins that is pretty good.  It is terribly marred by its childish quick cutting to add fake excitement of those with attention deficit disorder, and its constant harping about how global warming might impact the penguins and that we should all be up in arms about it.  As if the penguins haven't adapted to changes in climate over the past millions of years.  Give me a break.<br /><br />And finally, there is the delightful cartoon about Bugs Bunny trying to take an Ice-Show penguin who gets separated from his troupe back to the South Pole.<br /><br />This is a must have DVD and I recommend that everyone watch it and discuss it with their family and friends.  Just great.", 5.0
7720404,"Note: Hebrew with English subtitles.<br /><br />Synopsis: The '95 Israeli film `Devarim' (meaning: memory of things) is the first of three by writer/director/actor Amos Gita, (followed by `Yom Yom' '98 and `Kadosh' '99) which comprise his City Trilogy. The story unfolds in contemporary Tel Aviv focusing on three disillusioned, thirty-something friends; Cesar (played by Assi Dayan, son of the legendary Moshe Dayan), a moderately successful photographer and woman chaser, Israel (Amos Schub), an underachieving pianist and Goldman (Amos Gita), your everyday Mama's boy. When Goldman's Father dies the three men wake up to the reality that life is temporary and death eventually awaits us all. Soon there life paths are laid bare in this onslaught of newly obtained self-awareness and how they have been spending their time and energy come into question.  Will they discover their path to fulfillment and meaning or are they doomed to continue just going through the motions?<br /><br />Critique: On the back cover of the DVD case this film is described as a ""moody portrait of Israel's `lost generation'"" and indeed it is just that. There is a pervading feeling of oppression and futility here that is immediately discernible from the very first moment and continues unmercifully to the end. The story unfolds slowly, beginning one hot, sweltering summer's day in Tel Aviv where three men appear to live in a state of constant uncertainty, agitation and depression. Every word spoken, every action performed seems to be an automatic, unconscious response that is unconnected to personal thought or human emotion. They're just going through the motions of living while never partaking; working without experiencing a call to vocation, conversing without relating and having sex without loving. Theirs is a life of smoke and mirrors, as Goldman suggests in one pertinent conversation, the unconscious embracing of the ""little death"" in preparation for the ""big death"" to follow<br /><br />What I personally found intriguing was the first hand insight the film provided into the mindset of the non-religious Jew living in a land trapped in a constant state of emergency. What must it be like to live in a land surrounded by militant enemies who want to destroy you? A place where military service is mandatory and death at the hands of a suicide bomber can happen at anytime. While the religious residents of Israel may be able to deal with the situation by a worldview that envisions it to be all a part of God's ultimate plan what about those without religious faith to cling to? Surely it must be akin to living in a pressure cooker and that concept of impending doom and futility exudes from this film.<br /><br /> A fascinating subtext to the storyline was a rather long, philosophical discussion between Goldman and his Mother in the second half of the film. The conversation dealt with belief in God and atheism, suffering and death and finally personal freedom and the right to choose what one does with life. Goldman comes to the conclusion that committing suicide is the ultimate act one can perform to demonstrate that the individual can do with their life what they will. I found this to be a most revealing conclusion to come to by a non-religious Israeli who has spent his entire life in the shadow of Arabs making just that choice. For me that conversation provided an amazing glimpse into the psyche of the contemporary Israeli that made the film worth the time and effort.", 3.0

7883389,"MIAMI VICE, a film surrounded by rumors and preconceptions and a lot of money, is pretty much a bore - if story is important to you.  Michael Mann is a talented director and knows how to move action sequences and capture vistas and light versus darkness, and he can be reliable in creating character interplay. Can be, but in MIAMI VICE there doesn't seem to be a script to follow...<br /><br />Some of the more exciting actors in the field today were employed to deliver this movie about drug deals, undercover agents, and lots of violence, but they are wooden and seem to be reading their few lines from a TV prompter.  There is just no character development to speak of, no camaraderie between Rico and Sonny - factor that made the old TV show watchable.  But the cast is sterling: Colin Farrell (who needs a good meaty role before his allure falters), the fine Jamie Foxx (terribly out of his element here), a miscast flat Gong Li (?why?), the excellent Naomie Harris (by far the strongest character in the film), Elizabeth Rodriquez, Justin Theroux, Ciar&aacute;n Hinds (with an awful southern accent), and a set of new bad guys well chosen in Isaach De Bankol&eacute;, John Ortiz, and Luis Tosar. With talent like that you'd think the thing could fly on its own.  But despite some really gorgeous photography there just isn't anyone or anything to maintain the viewer's interest for the interminable 214 minutes of run time.

3012225,"There's a great clip in a ""Family Guy"" episode where the character Chris Griffen comes out of the Costner movie, ""No Way Out"" and yowls, ""How does Kevin Costner keep getting work????"". That pretty much sums up what I have always thought about Kevin's pinball-like quality of his projects: for every ""Dances With Wolves"", which I thought in fact did deserve its' praise and awards, there's a ""Tin Cup"". His acting ability has always come across onscreen as though Kevin himself knows, if he wasn't so damned good looking, he'd be relegated to background scenes and the best friend of the movie's hero. Not here: He makes what is, really, not that great a storyline - there are far too many side plots, red herrings, coincidences to move the script forward, etc. -, and puts it up at the four star, very close to the five star rating. Had he had better material to work with, and had this movie completely concentrated on Costner's serial killer character, I'd have given it that last star in a heartbeat. He plays, as other reviews note, Man Of The Year Earl Brooks, and while he has money, respect, a loving wife and many other perks, Mr. Brooks also has...issues. He likes to murder people, and he has been trying to beat that demon down for the last couple of years, but he's unfortunate enough to have a yappy, absolutely never-let-up id that only he can see and hear that is played to brilliance by William Hurt (As a matter of fact, why didn't Hurt get more praise for this turn? There's talk of his great, evil take all over the cult chat boards which follow this movie, but Hurt definitely deserved more than cult praise for this film). He gets hold of Kevin's Earl Brooks like a dog with a bone and just never lets up - Mr. Brooks thinks his main problems are being blackmailed and a daughter who may have possibly inherited the killing gene? Uh-uh, he's got the King of Looney Tunes in his own backseat, laughing, pouting and telling Earl to push that accelerator down through to the metal. Whether it is what I have always thought was a somewhat wooden acting ability on Kevin Costner's part finally finding the right role to showcase it - the uptight, perfect ""You have no idea what's going on inside me"" killer, or if he's a better actor than I ever gave him credit for, I have to admit, I don't know. But I do know that the entire movie could have and should have been about Earl Brooks and his crazy-as-hell alter ego, with Dane Cook as a blackmailer who has no idea what gate of Hell he's just opened (also, surprisingly good - see, I'm willing to admit when I've judged somebody incorrectly) as the one most important side plot, I'd have been more than happy with the screenplay. The detective sideline with Demi Moore is unnecessary, and even the exit ramp added regarding the pregnant daughter and her possible tendencies to follow in her dad's footsteps (or thumbprint, as it were) seems to be padding. They didn't need it with this movie - ""Mr. Brooks"" is a good/close to great movie because of Kevin Costner and William Hurt, and, since Kevin's the name that brings in the most Googling and queries about this film, you've got to be fair and give the majority of praise to him. It's his movie, he holds it together and he should do movies like this much more often. Watch this with other scary stuff for Halloween, and see if this one doesn't have you getting up and making sure the doors are locked.", 4.0

5858338,"I had very mixed feelings about Bill Murray through most of the 80s.  He was never one of my very favorites on SNL - seems to me he skated through that show, and though his easy charm was often an asset, sometimes it just looked lazy.  In his film work, he seemed to get increasingly ornery in his sarcastic attitudes, climaxing I think with the GHOSTBUSTERS films, where he almost seems to be mocking the audience and the rest of the cast and crew, acknowledging how stupid this crap is and that he's just going for the payoff.  At least, that was my take on him at the time, and by the early 90s I'd just about had enough of him; thankfully WHAT ABOUT BOB? and GROUNDHOG DAY changed my mind.  And the rest is history, as he's gone on to have arguably the best and most interesting career of any SNL alum.  Eddie Murphy and Steve Martin are doing stupid family comedies and endless sequels; Murray is working with Wes Anderson and Jim Jarmusch.  'Nuff said.<br /><br />SCROOGED comes from the period that I still have some issues with, but the thing is, he's SUPPOSED to be a total jerk throughout most of the film, and the snappy one-liners and flip attitude just help to make Scrooge (here TV executive Frank Cross) a little different from other Scrooges, and more relevant today; at least it feels like that's what's being attempted.  It worked pretty well, really, up until the ending transformation which, being still pretty much played for laughs, rings rather hollow.  Maybe we're not supposed to really believe in it or care, as long as we've had some good yucks?  I dunno.<br /><br />Anyway, it all boils down to our exec Frank putting on his own version of ""A Christmas Carol"", this one totally over-the-top and promoted so heavily that ""nobody will want to miss it"", with commercials so intense that one old lady dies while watching the ad.  Frank of course thinks it's a good idea to use that as part of the promotion.  But he's such a nasty and seemingly irredeemable egomaniac that his old dead partner Lew (John Forsyth) decides to send our familar ghostly friends to visit him and show him just how worthwhile the holiday that he sneers at really is.  They are cheroot-chomping cabbie David Johansen (Past), sadistic fairy Carol Kane (Present) and a more traditional skeletal Yet To Come, and they show him his happier, less-greedy life (with girlfriend Karen Allen who in this rendition is still around to give our younger-than-usual Scrooge/Cross a different kind of happy ending after the credits roll), all the ways he could help out others, etc.  You know the drill.<br /><br />The cast is the best thing about this; even if I'm still a bit amibivalent about Murray in this role, you can't really mind any movie that features a put-upon Bobcat Goldthwaite and tough-but-resigned Alfre Woodard sharing duties as the Bob Cratchit figure; Mary Lou Retton as Tiny Tim; Robert Mitchum as the certifiable insane network CEO who wants to make programs for cats; and best of all, Lee Majors as himself playing a commando come to rescue Santa in the faux-Christmas special ""The Night the Reindeer Died"" that opens the film.<br /><br />""Lee, this is ONE Santa who's goin' out the FRONT door.""<br /><br />Yeah, it's not the most ""Christmasy"" holiday movie, but it's definitely got it's moments.", 4.0

Let's hope The Last Full Measure, the final installment in this trilogy which also features Gettysburg, is on par with the aforementioned Gettysburg. The movie, for the most part, felt like a high school play...and a bad one at that. Lofty and highly unbelievable dialogue combines with actors who seem to feel uncomfortable in their wool reenactment costumes, creating an overall awkward viewing experience. Furthermore, had the film editors used a more discerning eye, the movie may have been more enjoyable. One finishes feeling like an hour could have easily been cut from the product. Something must be said for the battle sequences however. Often impressive and sometimes extremely poignant, they help to redeem the film. Overall, however, one could find another way of spending four hours. For a more moving and watchable Civil War experience turn to Gone with the Wind, Glory, or Gettysburg.

5178326,"I dig beck. From time to time his popular compositions ""Where It's At"" and ""Devil's Haircut"" runs in my mind. Can't get it off actually. But somehow I don't dig the ""fillers"" from his early albums... 'til he penned what I consider to be his MASTERPIECE... ""SEA CHANGE"". For those who wants his hip side (the samplings, funky, hip-hop trippers), most probably they've panned SEA CHANGE. Don't worry, I understand you. It's as if you wanna ask yourself why Beck would suddenly shift to become this melodramatic musician. But I listen to diversified types of music. And SEA CHANGE raised the bar of my respect for Beck even higher. After all, How could someone so hip can, all of a sudden, create a solemn album and yet it never went out of place. Instead, critics raved / loved it so much (For which I understand their judgement of the album). Rolling Stones even gave it 5 stars. And when I listened to it, I was held back, and even shed a tear (listen to Lonesome Tears with the background orchestra).<br /><br />  Now, let's go to GUERO. Before I listened to his latest release, I very much anticipated his hip side all over the album already...AND I WAS RIGHT. Almost all the songs are funky-cool but yet diversified in how they were executed. Whether it be Rock (E-Pro), Sunshine-Pop-Alternative (Girl), hip-hop (Que Onda Guero), trip-hop ""Sounding"" (Earthquake Weather, Go It Alone), melancholia (Broken Drum), psychedelia (Missing, Emergency Exit), World (Black Tambourine), Funk (Hell Yes), Country Rock (Scarecrow), Blues (Farewell Ride), Classic Rock Sound (Rental Car), 80's New Wave themed (Send A Message To Her)...Yeah it's all there AND, STILL, HIS PERFORMANCES AND ALL THE SONGS ON THE ALBUM NEVER WENT OUT OF PLACE. That's what makes a great composer, musician AND A GREAT ALBUM. And in these modern times where music compositions like these are rarely heard in one album, in my opinion, Beck deserves all the more respect from the music world whether from the new or older generation. I will never be surprised if this album gets nominated in the grammy's next year or even win Album of the Year (and numerous awards outside the grammy's frontier).<br /><br />  And, for me, this is the best from all his critically acclaimed hip albums (Mellow Gold, Odelay and Mutations). Here he sounds more mature. No wackiness. He's more serious, calm. So! I give 5 stars to THE WHITE BOY. It's worth a try! Still I consider SEA CHANGE His Classic Masterpiece.", 5.0

1961903,"For its relatively short length and somewhat minimalistic setting, ""Hard Candy"" is a film that contains more depth and complexity than I could ever touch on all of in this review.<br /><br />The story centers around two main characters, a young girl named Haley (Ellen Page), who meets an older man on the internet (Patrick Wilson, not to be confused with the drummer from Weezer) whom she suspects to be a sexual predator.  At first, it appears that she is falling for his act and taking the bait, and as they go back to his house, it is apparent to the viewer that bad things are on the horizon.  This is true, but not at all in the way that you'd expect.  Haley soon reveals herself to be an extremely angry and vengeful person who was plotting all along to take her deep-seated rage out on this guy.  I won't go into the specifics, but things get quite unpleasant for this fellow.<br /><br />What ensues is a very interesting and horrific ballet between the two, in which you see a dizzying array of different emotional layers in both characters.  One of the most brilliant things about this movie is that there is really no designated ""hero"" or ""villian"" here, and it's almost like your sympathy is meant to shift from one character to the other.  Jeff (the male character) is indeed revealed to be a pretty bad person, but we also see numerous moments in which he appears sympathetic, and you almost feel sorry for him, even knowing what kind of person he really is.  Likewise, Haley, while an obviously intelligent person with largely good intentions, is so driven by her vengeance and rage that she frequently comes off as frighteningly psychotic.  The lines of ""good"" and ""evil"" are so heavily blurred between them at times that there almost seems to be no protagonist at all.<br /><br />One of the biggest themes, obviously, is the irrational justification of depravity.  Haley talks about being disgusted by the ways in which pedophiles attempt to justify their actions, but ironically she is doing the same thing herself.  In her own twisted way, she feels that she is doing what has to be done, even though her actions are just as horrific.  We see these two characters that are both sick and twisted, albeit in very different ways, and neither can see their own hypocrisy, even if they can recognize it in each other.  There is so much more that can be discussed here, but I think I'll leave it at that.<br /><br />Now it is time to once again praise the incredible Ellen Page.  Many know her as the lovable title character in ""Juno"", but here she proves her amazing versatility with a nearly polar opposite type of performance.  Her performance is dark, venomous, and downright bone-chilling, and even with her small and unimposing stature creates a truly terrifying character.  But again, she's not a complete monster, and Ellen does an incredible job of bringing many different levels to the character.  Likewise, Wilson does the same for Jeff, in the sense that he is never completely a villian or a victim.  There is so much complexity to both characters, and both actors do an amazing job of bringing all those different facets together in their respective roles.<br /><br />The cinematography is awesome as well.  David Slade (who more recently did ""30 Days of Night"") is characteristic for using this sort of jerky camera effect, to give the sequences a sort of nightmarish surrealism.  The whole thing almost feels like a frightening dream, and entirely taking place between two characters in a small setting, it is all the more nightmarish.<br /><br />This is definitely not an easy film to watch, nor is it recommended to the faint of heart, but it is a brilliant examination of the dark side of human nature.  Whether you love it hate it, it will definitely stay with you long after it's over.", 5.0

3610963,"French director and writer Francois Ozon has created a moody and compelling film in &quot;Swimming Pool.&quot;  Charlotte Rampling stars as Sarah Morton, a prim and conventional English mystery writer who goes to the south of France in search of  inspiration.  There she encounters the other two main characters:  An old swimming pool and her publisher's sensuous French daughter, Julie (Ludivine Sagnier).  Sarah's pastoral serenity is soon disrupted as she becomes involved in the girl's unconventional and mysterious life.<br /><br />I loved this movie.  It has a leisurely pace and there is little in the way of action, and yet I found it mesmerizing.  The hypnotic intimacy we experience as we watch Sarah write her new book is utterly compelling.  There is an vague feeling of unease and fear from the moment Sarah arrives in France.  While all is outwardly calm and controlled, events gradually build to a thrilling climax and beyond that, an ending that makes the viewer reevaluate the entire movie.  The excellent musical score matches the enigmatic mood of the film.<br /><br />Charlotte Rampling is perfect as the proper and cranky old maid who lets her hair down in a big way, once she is under the spell of the luscious Provence countryside.  Ludivine Sagnier (seen recently as the delightful Tinkerbell in Peter Pan) is well-cast as the in-your-face, amoral young stranger who changes Sarah's life.  I think this is mainly a chick-flick, although there is ample nudity to keep the guys watching, too.

2039586,"""In the Heat of the Night"" won the Oscar for Best Picture of 1967. I was a Freshman in college that year, and all the talk was about ""Bonnie and Clyde"", a great film. ""The Graduate"" was doing the art-house circuit, and wasn't widely seen at the time. ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"" was, at the time, considered ostentatious (a rich Black man marrying the daughter of a rich White couple...how shocking!); the fifth nominee that year was Rex Harrison's ""Doctor Dolittle"", but I don't want to talk about that. I find that, 25 years later, I pull out ""In the Heat of the Night"" to get my kicks from brilliant film-making, as well as good suspense and fine acting and direction. This was Norman Jewison's first nomination for Direction, and not his last. Some say he lost it to Mike Nichols for ""The Graduate"" because Nichols probably should've won for his debut film effort, ""Virginia Woolf?"".Maybe. Some say Rod Steiger won his acting Oscar because he lost in '65 for ""The Pawnbroker"". I doubt it. In my humble opinion, this was Steiger's penultimate role, a man who  is so sure of himself, yet is taken down a peg by someone better. He will never show his insecurity, though you know it's there. I also believe, after watching this often, that Steiger's Gillespie is NOT racist, merely dealing with a racist environment. It's mentioned that he's the new sheriff, but it never says where he came from. This is good, because Steiger starts from scratch, builds a compelling character, shows a bit of lack-of-control, and it makes him nervous an wonderfully vulnerable. His mind is usually open. Virgil teaches him; hence, whatever happens later can only be for his benefit. Great characters. Poitier was in 3 good films in 1967: this one, ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"", ""To Sir, With Love"". I'm sure that, when nomination time came, his votes were divided. For this reason alone, I think he would've won. The performances of Lee Grant, Quentin Dean and Scott Wilson (he was in ""In Cold Blood"" that year) were stellar. The great old gospel singer, Jester Hairston, also had a small role; he dubbed the singing for Poitier's Oscar winning role in ""Lilies of the Field"" (""Amen!""). Interesting stuff! Sterling Silliphant's screenplay won the Oscar hands-down, a riveting narrative of a complicated book. The greatest thing about Steiger's performance is that you know nothing about him or his background when the film begins, or even when it's over. What you know is that he's stuck in a place he doesn't like and no one likes him; there are suggested gay overtones, especially when he's in his home and he and Virgil talk about loneliness. It's quite profound when he doesn't get the answer he wants. There's also the great Beah Richards, in a small cameo, as Mama Kaleba; a sweet but nonetheless reprehensible character; she was nominated that year for ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"", as Poitier's wonderfully heart-broken mother, a fine performance. Yes, 1967 was a great year. ""The Graduate"" broke a few barriers; ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"" broke some, and, certainly, ""Bonnie & Clyde"" made bad guys look good. Don't forget Richard Brooks' ""In Cold Blood""...A great year, but I still think ""In the Heat of the Night"" is the film I prefer to watch.", 5.0

He is both very convincing, yet he also appears to know that this film is just pure fun too.<br /><br />John Carpenter's career has been very up and down.  One film is dead on perfect only to be followed by a complete flop.  The great thing about him is when he's ""on"" as a director, writer, and musician, he is VERY on.  Some other classics of his you might want to check out are the original ""The Fog"" and ""The Thing"" (again with a terrific performance by Kurt Russell and a storyline much closer to the novel).  Both are truly creepy films with excellent musical scores.  They both still stand up well although both did relatively poorly at the box office in their time.  They later became cult classics on VHS and DVD.<br /><br />FYI: Carpenter also did a few wonderful non-horror films worth seeing.  He directed ""Music of the Heart"" which really earned him much deserved recognition and another Oscar nomination for his lead actress, Meryl Streep.  Look for a surprisingly pleasing performance by Gloria Estafan in it as well.  It's a great story about trying to teach music to inner city elementary kids.

4791131,"A film by Patty Jenkins<p>Roger Ebert listed ""Monster"" as the best film of all of 2003.  Charlize Theron won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her portrayal of serial killer Aileen Wuornos.  For months before the Oscars the talk had been about how amazing Theron's performance was and how not only was it the best performance of the year, it was one of the best performances in years.  This is a lot of high praise that raised my expectations on exactly what it was that I was going to see in ""Monster"".<p>""Monster"" is based on the true story of Aileen Wuornos.  Aileen lived as a prostitute in Florida and became a serial murderer, killing her prospective clients.  As the film opens, Aileen is sitting under an overpass and is reflecting back on past events, specifically her meeting of Selby (Christina Ricci).  After meeting Selby in a bar, Selby quickly becomes Aileen's best (and only) friend and also her lover.  They are both very lonely and needy people.  For the love of Selby, Aileen wants to clean up her life, quit hooking, and find a real job so she can support Selby.  Unfortunately for Aileen, she is unable to find a job because she has no work experience, no resume, and a huge chip on her shoulder that prevents anyone in a position to help to even want to help her.  Selby is demanding, telling Aileen that she needs to start hooking again because they don't have any money, she is hungry, and this is one thing that Aileen can do to support her.  <p>When she is raped by one of her clients, Aileen finally snaps and kills him.  She tells Selby that this was a one time thing, but after this first murder she starts killing and robbing her other clients.  It is at this point where we start to see Aileen crack under the pressure of what her life has become.  She feels that from day one she never stood a chance.  She was sexually abused as a child and by age 13 was pregnant and a prostitute.  This is her life and she has no opportunity to improve her life.  Her experience trying to find a legitimate job is proof of this.  ""Monster"" is the story of Aileen Wuornos and it is brutal and unflinching.  <p>It is impossible to separate the performance of Charlize Theron from the rest of the movie.  ""Monster"" is built on the raw power and pain of Theron's transformation into Aileen Wuornos.  This transformation was both physical and emotional.  Charlize Theron is a strikingly beautiful woman and early in her career the roles she became known for were little more than the beautiful wife/girlfriend/woman (Legend of Bagger Vance, The Devil's Advocate, The Cider House Rules).  ""Monster"" required a physical change in the appearance of Theron's face and the make-up helped change the beautiful Theron into the ugly Wuornos.  The other part of the transformation is that Wuornos was a tormented, pained, and angry woman and this required Theron to not simply be a woman acting but rather to ""become"" Aileen Wuornos.  She succeeds.  <p>During the first half of the movie I could not figure out why Theron had won the Academy Award for Best Actress.  She had become Aileen, but the performance was nothing terribly impressive for the first fifty minutes.  But when Selby confronts Aileen to return to being a prostitute, that scene nailed it for me and brought Theron's performance to an entirely new level.  The raw emotion Theron conveyed carried the movie.  The performance became more emotional, angry, vulnerable, fearful, and edgy and at no point did I think that this was Theron acting.  I saw Aileen Wuornos.  <p>The movie itself, without Charlize Theron, did not feel to me that it was telling a story that could not have been told on a made for cable (because of the content) movie.  But the movie is not so much about the plot and about the story, but rather about the performance and transformation of Charlize Theron into Aileen Wuornos.  The performance makes the viewer capable of feeling pity for Aileen without excusing her actions.  I don't feel that there is any question that Theron deserved the Oscar for ""Monster"".  <p>-Joe Sherry", 4.0

3912824,"Growing up in the supposedly 'post-feminist' era, I heard &quot;Stepford Wife&quot; thrown about in popculture reference to a severely represed woman without individual being. This dour description almost turned me off of this delightful movie. <p>Yet, a college intervention convinced me to give the title another chance. For the film wasn't actually celebrating such women, offering a cautionary tale instead of how dreary and horrific such life actually was. <p>The men of Stepford are supposedly happy with their robotic wives, but how secure are they with themselves if they had to create virtual doormats? Furthermore, what kind of homelife did this virtual hell create for the children (who undoubtedly would have been traumatized by the ordeal)?  <p>My feminist self liked the movie precisely because the classic script exploited the tension between culture and politics suspesfully. The camp factor (delightfully high) and the now dated appearance of many wardrobe ensembles adds to the overall sense of disorientation. We know something is not quite right, but cannot initally (along with the main character) decipher what it is untill revealled.  <p>Sure movie makers could have sat down, planned and filmed a conventional (inevitably stodgy) doccumentary showing how things are ultimately better when each woman is allowed to fufill their own individual dreams, but that would have not had the same appeal. Audiences at the 1975 premire and thereafter may have not realized they were participating in a feminist conciousness raiser themselves.<p>This film was intended for the audiences who would not neccessarily go down to the corner newstand and buy Ms. magazine, attend the meetings of the local feminist group, but nevertheless needed simmiliar information---and perhaps even more so than the other groups.", 5.0

There ois no way he would have made it through the storm, and rescue his son. They could have at least had his son die or something.

Most disaster movies focus on the country it's filmed in, but this one took the time to go to Japan and places in Europe and move down to Mexico.<p>When the Mexicans wouldn't let the Americans into the country, the Americans should have just pulled out the military and taken over the country. Tell the Mexicans to go to Brazil. It's partially their fault all this was happening.

4059132,"Going into this one, I was wondering if Sam Raimi would be able to top himself in the wake of his magnus opus SPIDER-MAN 2. Bluntly, the answer is no. But, listen, SPIDER-MAN 3 is still very much worth dropping your hard-earned dollars for. SPIDEY 2 was a five star film, this one rates as a four starrer and remains a quintessentially fun summer blockbuster picture.<br /><br />The special effects are seamless. CG Venom and the Sandman look great, while CG Spidey continues to astound. Admittedly, I wasn't too impressed with how the Goblin looked. You really gotta hand it to Sam Raimi, he knows how to handle epic superhero battles. In various fabulous faceoffs, Spidey takes on the Goblin, the Sandman, and Venom and, each time, our hero doesn't walk away without leaving a piece of himself on the floor. Even though we knew Spidey was going to come out on top, the fight scenes are credible and effective enough that he seems to be the underdog in each encounter. I have absolutely no complaints with the Spidey sequences.<br /><br />SPIDER-MAN 3 is again very well served with returning supporting actors J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson (hilarious!) and the sexy Elizabeth Banks as Betty Brant (more, please). Sam Raimi's buddy, Bruce Campbell, has a funny bit as a Maitre d', Mageina Tovah as the landlord's daughter brightens up the room with her endearing if skeletal presence, Stan Lee provides the obligatory cameo ('nuff said), Bryce Dallas Howard is essentially wasted as Gwen Stacy, and Rosemary Harris is the usual boring fount of wisdom.<br /><br />Folks have already mentioned the overstacking of supervillains and the onerousness of the multiple plot stories. I say, ""Phooey"" to that. I was able to track every story arc with ease and keep up with every character. In my opinion, the villains are drawn with just enough depth and are given ample back stories. By virtue of having been in every film installment, Harry Osbourne comes off as the most layered antagonist. James Franco, whom I normally dislike, is very good here. Flint Marko, aka The Sandman (Thomas Haden Church), is immediately revealed to be a sympathetic character as the audience, early on, becomes privy to his core motivation. Eddie Brock (a puny and miscast Topher Grace), however, is just plain bad egg. Now, there's a chance that newcomers to the Spidey mythos might be befuddled with the abrupt introduction of the inky, wriggly alien symbiote. Furthermore, Raimi then ignores the symbiote for lengthy film moments, opting to leave it in residence at Peter's cramped apartment to bide its time. Raimi is seemingly relying on the fans' knowledge of the alien costume to carry the day in lieu of actually sketching out some sort of a backstory. Not that there's much of a backstory on it in the comic book source. SECRET WARS, anyone?<br /><br />Hands down, Spidey's my favorite superhero. Like a host of kids, of the plethora of superheroes, it's Peter Parker with whom I identified the most when I was a mere tadpole. What makes him such a rootable underdog character is that Stan Lee and the ensuing comic book writers portrayed him as a sensitive teen/young man with relatable dilemmas who ekes out small victories in life even as he trounces heinous superbaddies. This film strays away from what makes him so likable. The start of SPIDER-MAN 3 finds a smug Peter Parker as Spiderman has become the toast of New York. His image is displayed on giant monitors and he is lauded in the newspapers (excepting the Bugle, of course). He even is presented with the key to the city. This same scene also comes up with an act by Peter as Spidey which is blatantly disrespectful towards Mary Jane. In fact, the success of his Spider-Man persona blinds him to what's going on with Mary Jane, whose career isn't flowing as smoothly. Understandibly, it's not too long before M.J. begins to feel that Peter isn't there for her. Suffice it to say, while I loved every Spidey sequence, there are moments here where I genuinely did not like Peter Parker.<br /><br />Or put another way, my dissatisfaction with Peter is actually a nod towards Kirsten Dunst's very effective performance. She's easily the best actor in this film and is so likable as Mary Jane that every thoughtless act by Peter towards her exacerbated my resentment towards the dude. I'm just not kosher with plotlines necessitating my hero to act like an obtuse jerk. And, since I'm crapping on the poor guy, I must say the hairstyle he chooses when under the symbiote's influence is less than cool. If it was supposed to emphasize his dark turn, it failed miserably, and the film, in my eyes, lost some credibility. The audience, including me, burst out laughing every time that goofy downswept hairstyle popped up. Unintended laughter - it's not a good thing.<br /><br />But I want to reiterate: Spider-Man is my favorite superhero. He got me thru junior high school (middle school, to you youngsters) and high school. I hated to criticize this movie, but it would've been wrong to merely leave it as a glowing review and to ignore the warts. Yet, with its flaws, SPIDER-MAN 3 is still very much a sensational movie, and I do feel that, ultimately, its positives outweigh the negatives. Tobey Maguire is the definitive Peter Parker, no matter what. I can't really envision anyone else in that role. Dunst, as always, is superlative and very lovely and oozes acting talent. The complex story, in spite of hitting a few false notes, did keep me involved. The action scenes are eyepopping, nothing at all wrong with them. Sam Raimi playfully continues to throw in insane gag bits and incidental, low key humor (for some reason, I like the doorknob bit). There's even several brief dance numbers, and it's up to you to laugh and go with it or groan and grouse. Most, hopefully, will do the former.", 4.0
