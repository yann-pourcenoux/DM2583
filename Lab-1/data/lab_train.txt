5769784,"Before I begin I'd just like point out that I am not reviewing this film as a work of ""art"" -- on that score, it seems just as good as most films, if not at least a little better -- but as a work of propaganda.  I will also try to avoid the mistake made by 99% of the customer reviewers on Amazon who think they have to recount the plot blow-by-blow, in excruciating detail (and often erroneous detail), even though a hundred other reviewers have already done so, and even though there is already a much better, more consice, and more accuarate Editorial Review at the top of every product page....<br /><br />A couple of years before 9/11, Tom Clancy wrote a novel, ""The Sum of All Fears,"" about a group of Islamic extremist-terrorists who are planning to set off a nuclear device in America.  When Hollywood turned this film into a movie, also before 9/11, they decided that it was much more plausible and responsible to make the bad guys white-supremacist neo-nazis.  Golly, and they wonder why the rest of the country views most people in the entertainment industry as knee-jerk liberals?!<br /><br />I saw ""The Siege"" when it first came out in theaters, and have recently viewed it again on television, and it seems even worse now than when I first saw it, because of 9/11.  At the time I saw the movie, I thought that it presented an implausible and unrealistic scenario regarding America's reaction to such a terrorist threat, but I did think they were presenting a plausible and realistic scenario regarding that terrorist threat.  When 9/11 happened, I was shocked and outraged, but I was also not surprised.  An open and free society such as ours has always been vulnerable to such attacks, and always will be -- AND SO WE STILL ARE.  The only thing that surprised me is that it has taken the terrorists so long to figure it out, and sometimes I think they still don't realize their potential.<br /><br />Not all Arabs are Muslims, but most profess to be.  Not all Muslims are extremists or terrorists, but a very few are.  And ALL of the terrorists who caused 9/11 WERE.  If ""The Siege"" is any indication, Hollywood apparently thinks most of the unwashed masses in flyover country don't know this.  Hollywood apparently thinks that most Americans (or at least most White Americans) are racist, sexist, stupid, and evil.  Hollywood apparently thinks that America is more at fault for terrorism than the extremists.  Hollywood apparently thinks that it is unacceptable to point out that there are more than a few people in the Arab and Muslim communities who hold negatively stereotypical views of America, Christians, Israel, Jews, etc. and that the extremists use those stereotypes to justify their terrorism.  This is where ""The Siege"" fails.<br /><br />After the worst terror incident in the film -- a truck bomb kills six hundred people in the building which houses the NYC FBI headquarters, effectively wiping out its anti-terroism agency -- having an army division occupy Brooklyn and declare martial law while they screen two thousand recent Arab immigrants that fit the profile of the twenty terrorists they are looking for hardly seems all that unreasonable.  In fact, the two-star general's rationale for this approach is quite logical.  But, of course, this is Hollywood, so this two-star general just has to be some sort of bigoted homicidal maniac who wraps himself in the flag and despises his president and the constitution.  After all, the only unacceptable government spending is on defense, and the only acceptable time to use the military is when we can guarantee that our country could not possibly benefit in any way from it -- anything less than perfect altruism is absolute corruption.  And, naturally, the military then proceeds to run amok in Brooklyn, torturing and murdering the innocent with impunity, all the while condemning any critics for daring to question their patriotism.  Funny, isn't it, how after five times as many people die on 9/11, a conservative Republican president reacts with far, far more restraint than ""The Siege""'s Bill Clinton?!  Sure, there have been abuses, but they have been the EXCEPTION, whereas ""The Siege"" posits that they would be the RULE.<br /><br />What this film, and much of America, and much of the world, fail to understand is this:  what Osama bin Laden, Al Quaeda, Islamofascists and terrorist-extremists hate about US is that we are not exactly like THEM.  Some Palestinians, like the Nazis, will not be happy until there are no more Jews left breathing on the face of the earth.  The Islamofascists will not be happy until everyone on the planet who does not surrender to THEIR particular interpretation of Islam is DEAD.  Pulling out of Palestine, pulling out of Iraq, electing a liberal Democrat to the American presidency will NOT put an end to it.  In fact, NOTHING will put an end to it.  There will always be terrorism, terrorists, extremism, extremists, crime, criminals, etc.  But as long as we choose idealism over reality, we will only be giving them more power.  Remember, it is THEIR idealism that makes them so willing to kill and die for their cause....<br /><br />One final note: remember that a work of fiction proves NOTHING.  No work of fiction can ""prove"" ANYTHING.  The writer is the god of his own fictional universe, and he gets to set all of the rules, so naturally what he writes ends up justifying his own point of view.  Imagine a presidential debate where only one candidate gets to speak -- for BOTH sides!  This is the case with ""The Siege,"" with Jack London's ""The Iron Heel,"" and pretty much any and all books and films.  So to call this film ""realistic"" or ""prophetic"" is patently absurd.  Still, I recommend seeing it at least once, whether you saw it before 9/11 or not.  The one thing that this film does prove, albeit unintentionally, is that Hollywood does make great propaganda.", 1.0

262908,"Having been a fan of Walt Disney movies for years now, I was extremely pleased to find that Bambi was coming out on DVD. I instantly placed an order for it, it arrived within a few weeks (well before the projected due date) and was in perfect condition.<br />This film also contains so many special features, if you enjoy seeing the works of animation, you most certainly will enjoy this movie. It is filled with the poignant Disney magic, which we all remember, but along with it comes a wonderful backstory to the coming about of Bambi; one of the Disney movies which revolutionized the world of animation, using the multiplane camera to further the realism effects obtained in Bambi, impressionistic backgrounds and realistic, yet human animals, round out just a few, of the many, interesting aspects of this 1942 classic Disney film.<br />A great addition to any Disney lovers collection!! Certainly a must have in my book!!", 5.0

5564941,"This is a very entertaining film!  It is one that I have watched many times over the years.  I actually saw this in the theater, because I was and am such a fan of Chevy Chase.  However, this came out after his heyday, and it was di rigeur (sp?) by that time to bash anything that Chevy did.  I even liked some of his talk show stuff, but that is another matter isn't it!  Say what you want about Chase, he had a fantastic run didn't he?  If you are a fan of comedy, then you must admit that he left his mark.  I can't imagine that anyone watching this couldn't get some entertainment out of it.  If you know it is about an invisible man, then I think you know somewhat what you are getting into, if you don't care about that stuff, then obviously stick to what you like, but this was a good one, and if I were Chevy I'd be very proud to have this in my porfolio of films, cheers.", 4.0

5001735,"After screening about twenty minutes of this thing on my 60-inch plasma, I realized the TV had been irretrievably compromised by having this filth routed through it, so I had to lay my TV gently on the den floor and then smother it with a pillow.<br /><br />This movie should have been entitled Revolting People Who Are Not in the Least Bit Funny.  The movie is pathologically unfunny.  It is so unfunny, it is very hard to tell where the humor is supposed to lie.  Instead, the movie is a bleak yarn about stand-up comedians whose material is... supposed to be funny, apparently, judging by title and by the tittering of the comedy audiences in the movie, who constitute a kind of living laugh track.  But I cannot begin to fathom what is supposed to be funny about this material.  ""If the guy from MySpace (big MySpace logo in background, clearly a product placement) and the guy from Craigslist got in a fight, I wonder who'd win.""  This is one of the ""jokes"" in the movie that is supposed to be funny.  Then James Taylor features in the movie as a kind of commercial for himself, to no purpose whatsoever.  The only way I could make sense of this movie is as an anti-comedy: a movie that is supposed to be funny only because it is so completely unfunny.  However, this subtle type of humor is rarely intentionally perpetrated.  But if you want some genuine anti-comedy stand up material, here it is:<br /><br />(COMEDIAN GETS UP ON STAGE, COMES TENTATIVELY TO MICROPHONE) ""Uhh... hi.  The um, the scheduled comedian is stuck in traffic and he sent me over here to fill in for him till he gets here."" (LOOKS NERVOUS, CONSULTS PIECE OF PAPER, SAYS TREMULOUSLY) ""So uhhh... he emailed me some of his material and I'll ask you to bear with me while I get through it the best I can... (SQUINTS) But it's kind of hard to read.  My printer is low on toner.  I don't know if you've noticed, but Brother printers seem to eat toner.  For a couple years I had an Epson, which somehow lasted a lot longer on a single toner cartridge... though I might have been using it on the low-toner setting... I'm not quite sure.  You know how you can set the printer, through the computer, to be in toner-saver mode?  I think I might have done that with that other one... I don't know why I've never bothered to do that with the printer I have now but umm... Anyway, let's get started on some of this material and hopefully we can work through about half of it before Joe gets here.  But (CONSULTS WATCH) since I've been talking I see about five minutes have elapsed and so I'd better go through the material at about one and a half times normal speed in order to catch up... but then, that might not be very funny... on the other hand it might make it funnier... show of hands, who out there thinks that speeding things up makes them funnier?  C'mon now... okay, one... two... three... only three people?  Okay, well, I guess I could ask now who DOESN'T think speeding things up makes them funnier... but then I already know the answer, don't I?  I mean I could just subtract three from  the total number of people in the room... but then I suppose some people might not have an opinion one way or the other and so that approach might not work.  (CELL PHONE RINGS) Oh... could you... could you excuse me a moment?  I've GOTTA get this... Hello?  (LOWERS VOICE TO AN ANGUISHED, HISSING WHISPER) Where ARE you?!  ... You're, you're goddam right I'm filling in for you, I'm onstage right now.  That's right.  Right now.  I am standing in front of the audience.  How's it going?!  Well it's not going too well.  Because they're not laughing.""<br /><br />Apatow's movie, on the other hand, completely fails to accomplish anything in the humor or anti-humor department.

Every single time that the vampire walked into the room towards Harker, I felt compelled to hide under a table or a safe area!<br /><br /> This is the story of a young townsman named Jonathan Harker, who is sent a business letter by a certain &quot;Orlock&quot;, whom Harker simply knows as a rich count. So, Harker embarks on a long journey through mysterious mountainous, woodsy, and shrouded places to the count's ominous castle. The next events in this silent masterpiece are too terrifying to explain. The best horror film, beside Phantom of the Opera and Metropolis, ever made in our early history. Possibly even in our long century.<br /><br /> Are we ready for some serious discussion? Can we talk? Unfortunately, countless bad prints, both VHS and DVD, have been made of Nosferatu. The Goodtimes Video release has grainy image quality, but is in the original black & white color format. It does not have a musical score.<br /><br /> A tinted version by Type O Negative has pretty good image quality, but a distracting soundtrack.<br /><br /> Blackhawk has produced a fairly credible DVD of this classic, with fuzzy image quality but a classical music score.<br /><br /> Madacy has released an expensive DVD. The picture and sound quality also leave something to be desired.<br /><br /> Yet another VHS print was duplicated by Timeless Video. I own a VHS version of Metropolis released by Timeless Video, and found it to be better than I expected, though the quality is shoddy compared to the Kino Video print.<br /><br /> The Kino DVD of Nosferatu is the best on the market yet. The picture quality is fine, and the soundtrack is suitable.<br /><br /> This old horror classic is guaranteed to send a chill up your spine. So purchase the Kino version today!", 5.0

2860234,"I loved the book but missed the movie when it came out. I put off buying the DVD because I couldn't see the lead actors as Russian. Finally I bought it and enjoyed the movie, except that William Hurt's attempt at sounding Russian was pretty bad. He sounded more British than anything else. A coach could have been used; or better yet, a Russian actor. Or no accent at all. If the movie was made today I bet they would have fixed that, but at the time Hurt was really hot and you have to sell tickets.<br /><br />Anyway, enough of this; if you can suspend your disbelief about Hurt's accent, the movie is interesting and engaging, and it was a great story. I did think the detective solved the case rather suddenly; it might have been better to reveal the plot more gradually. But movies have to simplify things to be watchable.", 4.0
2925919,"This is an excellent film in many ways.  It is unique, thought-provoking and deals with unflinching honesty about one of the most important yet sloppily analysed facets of our modern liberal society, drug addiction, whether legal or illegal. <p>There are many reasons why this is an important film:<p>Firstly the subject matter - drug addiction and it's effect on all our lives - is intelligently and thoughtfully explored.  Not something one encounters often in films noawadays.<p>Secondly the production and direction are masterful.  The Director uses many innovative techniques to create emotions often outside of the cinematographic repertoire.  The final half of the film feels as if you are in a mad dizzying rush forward as the film drives onwards to it's harrowing, emotional climax.  It may not be the most subtle approach but it succeeds beyond doubt. <p>Thirdly, the film is not hindered by nostalgia, it is brutally honest in how it thinks the protagonists would behave in real life and attains a strong degree of realism.  The result of this is that the film is often harrowing and disturbing but never greatuitously.  The viewer is not manipulated and treated in a condescending way as in so many films - this feels real.<p>Fourthly, the performances are first-rate - Ellen Burstyn in particular puts in a great turn as the doting mother with an inadverent addiction to slimming pills. <p>Darren Aronofsky, the Director, shows a uniquely compelling approach with serious subject matter.  This is a film to watch and consider; it will stay with you long after it has finished - altogether superior film-making.<p>Hugely recommended!", 5.0

3857418,"The basic question is worth asking. Start with a world of natural and synthetic bodies, natural and synthetic thoughts, and all combinations along both axes. What percentage of each does it take for some mind in some body to be human?<p>The lead character is well placed to ask the question. She convincingly answers the question in her own case. The plot that carries her along is a man(?)-hunt in a futuristic urban landscape. For all its skyscrapers and other features, the city still has its crowded streets, banners, and open store fronts. They are part of the answer, functioning human communities in a man-made physical environment.<p>The animation was uniformly good throughout, but I found the script to have a choppy pace. There were long, leisurely canal rides between the chases and shooting, and long philosophical monologues.

2451637,"I can see why this film was scorned back in the 70's. It is hard to sit down and watch this film without wondering if there is something wrong with you. The rape scenes are long, brutal, and unrelenting. What makes this film so tough to watch is the fact that the actress is raped not once, twice, three, or four, but five times! Worse, the rape scenes make up the bulk of the movie, so basically you're watching a woman being raped at length for what seems like most of the film's running time. Infamously, Roger Ebert was moved to call this film ""vile garbage""!<br /><br />Still, the film is brilliant in that it clearly uses shock to show how terrible rape is and how a woman suffers during the ordeal. But that's only part of the story. This is a rape-revenge movie. So after the rape, comes the revenge. Most of the women who have championed this movie have praised the revenge section of the film. Most men seem to hate the actress for taking her revenge to the umpteenth degree. ""Violence definitely breeds more violence"" as the saying goes. And this film is very, very violent. This is not family friendly entertainment!<br /><br />I personally think this film does have a positive message and that message is: if a man takes away a woman's right to control what happens to her body, he could end up having a very bad day.", 4.0
1973186,"I had The Help pegged as another one of those chick lit movies that middle aged women go to see in droves.  After the fiasco that was Eat, Pray, Love, I had a hard time trusting my mother's ability to pick out a film for us to watch.  Female sagas of love and harrowing times seems overdone, clich&eacute;, boring.  I expected The Help to be just another blah movie that left me cold and unsatisfied.<br /><br />The Help is the story of a young college grad named Skeeter, an aspiring journalist, and her attempt to tell the stories of the black maids that lived and worked for white families in Jackson, Mississippi in the early 1960s.  Skeeter is a feisty girl who doesn't want to live the life that society has her pegged for - an obedient housewife who plays bridge and gives birth to babies she won't even care for.  The biggest influence in her life was her family's housekeeper Constantine, the black woman who raised her when her mother ignored her in favor of friends and shopping.  Constantine inspires her to seek out these maids and ask them to tell their stories and experiences, challenging the status quo of society in a great period of racial turmoil in Jackson.  The story combines hope, fear, hatred, and willpower from various viewpoints, telling the stories of various women whose lives are deeply affected by Skeeter's goal.<br /><br />Viola Davis' performance as Aibileen, a maid for a well-to-do Jackson socialite, is impressive, along with Emma Stone's solid performance as Skeeter, but the star of The Help is Octavia Spencer's amazing and heartfelt portrayal of Minnie.  While only a supporting role, Spencer's performance was superb and Oscar-worthy, bringing together a sense of comedy with fear and anger, not only at the family she works for but also the life that she's been forced to live and pull her children through.<br /><br />The performances are what makes this story and brings it to life.  I haven't read the book and cannot speak for it, but everything I saw on screen felt real and powerful.  The lives of these women, from the maids to the snotty housewives and socialites, from the budding journalists to the despairing young wives trying to satisfy their husbands and their societies, each was affecting and felt true and powerful.<br /><br />I went into the movie expecting boring and dull.  I left satisfied and ready to talk about these times, wanting to know more about the time period and ask my grandparents (from the deep south) about their experiences during the time.  The people in my theater, men and women alike, young and old, black and white, all seemed to enjoy the movie.

7217681,"Am I the only one who thinks that John Woo is overrated?  I have enjoyed many of his films, but he has become a parody of himself.  In any given John Woo film, you are sure to see doves fluttering through the air, a stand-off between two protagonists simultaneously pointing guns at each other, a woman whose only real reason for being in the film is to form a triangle with said protagonists, far too much slow motion photography and a healthy dose of obvious religious imagery that has little, if anything, to do with the story.  This time around, I just couldn't work up any interest in what I was seeing.  It all felt so tired and old.  And that motorcycle duel belongs on a short list of the most ludicrous action sequences I have ever seen.  This film is only for those who believe that Woo can do no wrong.", 2.0

These are silent cartoons (just a soundtrack played in the background with the occasional screen-sized caption for dialogue or plot).  The art is fairly basic, but the animation is still all right.<p>That's not to say that this DVD is not etertaining.  It can be quite funny, and it's really interesting to see this very early stage of Felix's evolution.  For collector's and die-hard Felix fans, it's a must.

2570467,"The story is very simple.  It's about a champion ballroom dancer who has always wanted to dance his own unconventional steps.  Doing so, however, he might please the crowd, but not the judges.  Three weeks before the Pan Pacific competition, Scott Hastings (the protagonist) has a falling out with his partner for this reason.  Little does he know that by teaching a beginner to dance the way he wants to dance, his world would be turned upside down.  At the core, this is a lovestory between Scott and his ""ugly-duckling"" student Fran (short for Francesca).<p>The choreography is nothing short of stunning.  The dancing is an integral part of the movie.  It tells part of the story.  The protagonist ends up learning a new style of dancing called Para Dos (Spanish for ""for two"") as he reaches a point in the story where he realizes that his life is not to be lived alone anymore; when he finds love.<p>This film catapulted Baz Luhrmann's career.

4017711,"A wonderfully crafted film!  We love it!  It's visually beautiful with wonderful acting that is believable and real.<br /><br />I pause to make the comment about how anybody could give this film three stars. This is not contrived Disney-like dribble in the least. I actually gravitate toward Foreign cinema because it is just exactly the opposite of American dribble. It's just that people today are so negative, they can't handle anything loving and good with out tearing it down because they are empty inside and have an attitude of ""if I am not happy, no one else can be happy either.""  Hmm, sounds like selfishness and an over inflated sense of self.  Hey, no wonder you're miserable.<br /><br />never-the-less . . .<br /><br />You grow to love the main characters and empathize with them.  You know this film has something good ahead.  It's fun along the way.  Little bits of sunshine and happiness.<br /><br />The film's core theme is true: don't get so wrapped up in yourself and your troubles that you forget to tell the important people in your life, ""I love you.""  The little French girl (brilliant little actress)in the film is in many ways a metaphor for a beautiful butterfly herself. Or is the butterfly their friendship (the grandfather figure and little girl?)<br /><br />You know this film will end happily (it has to), but you just don't know exactly how.  It's like, your going to get a gift; but what?<br /><br />To the end, your like, ""What's going to happen?""<br /><br />And the film keeps rewarding you again and again emotionally right up to ""FIN"".<br /><br />The world definitely needs more films like this gem!  The same emotional flavor as ""My Father's Glory"", and as worthy as ""Kikijuro"" in it's poignant little story and honest heart.  As important to see as ""Salaam Bombay"" but for a much more brighter reason.", 5.0

15431,"This film is underrated by both regular movie goers and Argetno fans, usually it is panned because of how bizzare it is, but the thing about an Argento film is that he has never been good at writing a narrative . For him the important thing is to affect you emotionally and psychologically, not in an intellectual way. This is probably his most bizzare and his most beautiful film. It is about a girl named Jennifer Corvino(Jennifer Connelly) who enrolls in a Swiss boarding school and her classmates are being murdered by a mysterious killer. She has a gift of being able to communicate telepathically with insects and with the help of an entomologist(Donald Pleasence) she tracks down the killer using her power. While i admit some of the narrative seems somewhat ridiculous it is a lush and beautiful film which has the feeling of a dream and Jennifer Connelly who has also starred in DARK CITY and REQUIEM FOR A DREAM is good enough in her first leading role. It also features a great musical score by Goblin and Bill Wyman. It also features the director's wife, Daria Nicolodi, and his one of his daughters, Fiore Argento. Watch for her in the impressive and scary opening sequence. You will notice this film is similar in many ways to SUSPIRIA but it manages to stand on it's own.

5257409,"It's a long time since Ian Curtis's solemn laments of thwarted love have hit my turntable. And in spite of the longevity of Joy Division's successor, New Order, I confess that the demise of Curtis, an authentic Rock tragic, singled the demise of my interest in their music. What explanation is there for an attraction to talent extinguished prematurely; the titillation of having glimpsed, sometimes stared at some gift that was squandered? In many instances, and Curtis's is among them, early, meteoric talent most likely was fufilled...fatalism was written into it, the biography and art in perfect tandem. Their music already sounded as if it was rising from the grave, a severly cold other place. That's what the popular press has continued to feed us over the ensuing decades. In this sense Corbijn's film is no exception. You buy the Q magazines or NME, whatever, for some fresh insight to such legends. But there isn't any. The film's script has been anticipated in the music; alienation of the inner, poetic self from the cramped and dour quotidian life of cramped, urban, Macclesfield. The band's public image, as per Corbijn's recreation has been honorably projected, mesmerizingly so by Sam Riley...the entire slow surge of its black and white cinematography inexorably, hauntingly moving toward the last gasp in that sad little kitchen. The acting is so convincing that you often feel it's a documentary rather than an interpretation. There is no sensationalism to be found in Curtis's life or death. For all its Doors-like anthemic sound, Curtis was no aspirant Jim Morrison.", 4.0

Among Dario Argento's finest works, it is an eerie psychological thriller which is part Hitchcock, part Raymond Chandler novel, and part Cinecitta.  The story is believable and captivating, the suspense is chilling, the acting is superb.  Of course there's great music, with Ennio Morricone at the helm of the sounds, and of course there's all kinds of good-looking people, cool cars, and stylish set pieces, just as you'd expect from an Italian film from 1970.

6324899,"CSI is one of the best dramatic series in years!  This compilation of the first season shows why.  Blessed with wonderful scripts, superb acting, imaginative music and cinematography, the series deserves its years of high ratings.  The main reason is the intelligence with which the writers show in their viewers; not every episode has a wrapped up ending; the villains don't always get caught and the regulars have their own personal demons to deal with.  The show's foundation is William Petersen, who brings a depth of dimension to his role as the chief of the forensics team.  At times harsh and apparently unfeeling, he can turn around and show much empathy and compassion and he cares about his team.  Marg Helgenberger as former stripper Katherine is a single mother, recently separated from her two timing husband (Timothy Carhart); she is right on target as a woman trying to mix a career and family; George Eads is the hunky Nick, whose desire to please Grissom results in some poor decisions, but one can't deny his dedication; Gary Dourand's Warrick is a gambling addict having difficulty shaking the habit; Jorja Fox is the workaholic and lonely Sarah, who has a fierce loyalty and determination; Eric Zmandza is wonderful as the laidback but frenetic Greg, and Paul Guilfoyle is marvelous as former CSI chief, now detective.  The entire supporting cast of regulars is perfect.  The show hooks you right away with the lead in case, and it's not always murder!  CSI is evidence that television when it sets its mind to it can bring you great viewing.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.", 5.0

273125,"McCourt set out to make a miserable movie about a miserable place in a miserable time.  He wanted to succeed in painting a picture so drab and weary that you're likely to leave the theater feeling guilty that you have no holes in your pockets and wonder bread in the cubbard.  He does succeed, he's made a fine picture, but he's made it for himself and not us.  It's about a grown up boy from Limerick coming to terms with the past, it's really him behind the camera releasing the pain as if it were an Exodus from Egypt.  Angela's Ashes is therapy for him.  It's angry, and I think that's fine, because he just about convinces us that he has the right to make this kind of movie even if we don't.  It goes to supersede the kind of realism that the Italians were talking about.  Fellini wrote and directed about childhood poverty, but not this kind of poverty, he wanted us to identify with the universal human spirit whereas McCourt doesn't think we have the right to.  He says that even if you're poor in America you're not this poor, and if you are you can still tell your father you love him without being laughed at.  There are some emotional payoffs in the movie: his aunt's unexpected kindness, his first sexual experience, his luck in finding passage to America.  But the movie isn't about those scenes, the script and direction don't treat them with the same kind of meticulous care.  They dance on the brink of being superfluous, they make the film uneven; those scenes don't belong in the kind of movie he really needed to make.  The contrast isn't strong enough, but it's a good film, and I hope you see it, just like I hope McCourt is able to find some closure.  After all, that's who you're really rooting for, the man who wrote the book, the voice over that assume his identity; You're just not too sure about the characters on the screen.  Receiving a film is a completely subjective.  It's very possible you may not respond to this kind of movie, you may think it too pretentious and too angry, or you may very well find it an enlightening experience.  It's worth discovering for yourself, isn't it?", 3.0

3059621,"I have to say that ""The Machinist"" is easily the most unsettling, disturbing and bizarre film I have seen so far this year.  I mean, you can tell from reading the back of the DVD cover and seeing how disturbingly thin Christian Bale in pictures from the movie that this is not going to be a very happy time.  Yet, last night I was in the mood for something dark and uncompromising.  I got it and then some with this cleverly haunting film that is unforgettable.<br /><br />Bale plays ""Trevor Reznik,"" a troubled and fatigued machinist who hasn't slept for a year.  He lives his life in isolation, with the few minor exceptions such as a friendly prostitute who takes a liking to him and an airport coffee shop waitress he visits every night.  Things take a turn for the worst when he meets a fellow machinist for the first time... but nobody knows who this guy is.  They tell Trevor that he doesn't exist.  The paranoia and confusion leads to a horrific accident on the job that involves his co-worker.  And that's when he gets the strange notes in his apartment.  Either Trevor is completely delusional and has lost his mind... or somebody really is out to get him.<br /><br />What's really intriguing about the movie is that just like Trevor, we do not know exactly what is real or what is made up.  There are times when we're doubtful of what we're seeing, and then we get roped in and second-guess ourselves.  The movie is a non-stop dread fest that just speaks of loneliness and paranoia, and that's why it works.  It looks and feels exactly like it should.  From the very first few minutes, it's easy to realize that this is going to be one unsettling and dark experience.  It is one that you may want to re-watch after you see it all.  You'll definitely think about it for a while after it's all said and done, but personally I didn't think it was that hard to piece together after it was over.  It made sense, and it made even more sense on the second viewing.  Christian Bale is fantastic in this.  I can't believe he dropped down to around 100 pounds for the role.  Yes, you should be warned that Bale looks EXTREMELY skinny in this... almost like a walking skeleton, as was intended in the script.  I think the movie was very well written and directed.<br /><br />This isn't a movie for those who get easily disturbed or freaked out.  It's a pretty uneasy movie to watch.  Let's just say you won't feel extremely cheerful after you get done watching this.  You may want to put on something funny after you're done, otherwise you're going to have this movie stuck in your head while you try to sleep.  The DVD has a little to offer in the extra features department, such as commentary from the director, a making of feature, 8 deleted scenes and the theatrical trailer.<br /><br />I really enjoyed ""The Machinist.""  It surprised me and kept me hooked from beginning to end.  I have to say that I kind of missed watching dark movies like this.  Seems like there's too many ""cutesy-wutesy"" movies for the family, so it's good to see something so brutal, so raw and so in your face like this.  If you want to be disturbed and see something that isn't your typical thriller, ""The Machinist"" is something to put down on your list of movies to see.  As depressing and dreadful as this movie can get... I'm ready to see it again. -Michael Crane", 5.0

I've not read the book, nor seen the original, so I had no expectations for the story.<br /><br />This was typical Tim Burton fare: well-directed, with impressive visuals and a great cast. Burton always manages to assemble a great cast, and bring the best out of them. Not that Johnny Depp needs any real coaching to do a good job, mind you. The kid actors are splendid, which was good to see; if they hadn't been capable of doing a good job, this movie would have been toast.<br /><br />As for the storyline...it's a little oddball, and Willy Wonka clearly is calculating and non-personable (though I'mnot sure kids would see it this way)....all the kids who suffer horrible fates are clearly suffering pre-planned fates. Willy Wonka is clearly a character which needs redemption, and he does get it by movie's end, but the achievement of that goal seems a little weakly executed. This is a weak point on my part though, and shouldn't stop folks from enjoying the movie.<br /><br />This is not Tim Burton's best work, but it's still good, and definitely something to take the kids out to see!", 4.0
7454352,"As you probably know, the &quot;Why We Fight&quot; series was produced by Frank Capra when he was a major in the U.S. Army Signal Corps. The series was commissioned by Army Chief of Staff, General George C. Marshall, as a way of indoctrinating all the troops who signed up in the wake of Pearl Harbor and the declaration of war. The idea was to make it clear we were doing more than just remembering Pearl Harbor. Eventually the series was shown to the public in theaters across the country. This introductory film in the &quot;Why We Fight&quot; series covers the events leading up to the Second World War, focusing on the rise of Fascism in Italy and Germany, the Japanese attacks on Manchuria, and the United States' lack of military preparedness. The last is particularly interesting because it implicitly explains Pearl Harbor not as a Japanese victory, but rather as an American defeat (we lost rather than they won). &quot;Prelude to War&quot; defines World War II in black and white terms as the totalitarian worldwide conspiracy threatens to turn the free world into a slave world. Admittedly a propaganda film, this 1942 documentary is quite informative, explaining about Hitler's book &quot;Mein Kampf,&quot; Lebensraum, the Tanaka Plan, the London Naval Treaty, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, the Nuremberg Laws, and even such details as the Roman fasces. <p>This 54-minute black &amp; white film won the Academy Award for best documentary in 1942 and the series as a whole is credited with redefining the documentary as an art form. Of great historical value, it must be underscored that &quot;Prelude to War&quot; is not exactly propaganda in the most pejorative sense of the term. The film's great &quot;sin&quot; along those lines is that it makes the case that public opinion was moving in the direction of joining the war. Instead of dismissing this film and Capra's efforts as the American counterpart to what Goebbels was doing in Nazi Germany, it is more accurate to think of it as being the film equivalent of a prosecutor's speech in a trial. &quot;Prelude to War&quot; makes much better use of evidence without the radical distortion you usually find in classic examples of propaganda.", 5.0

4735080,"That's the ultimate question that living legend Clint Eastwood asks in ""Gran Torino"", thematically, perhaps the finest movie of his long and distinguished career. As everyone knows, Eastwood has aged beautifully as both an actor and director over the past 20 years, and both the timing and venue of his exploration of The American Character (either through planning, coincidence, or a bit of both) is impeccable.<br /><br />With the American economy in meltdown and the auto industry dented badly by foreign competition, retired Ford worker Walt Kowalski tries to keep both his cherished Gran Torino and his way of life intact as the ground shifts beneath him in a newly globalized world. With his wife (and most of his generation) having passed on, and immigrants (visible reminders of Kowalski's time in Asia) representing an ever-larger portion of an uneasy melting pot, Eastwood's newest ""anti-hero"" defaults to racial stereotypes as a defense mechanism (as do the street gangs representing various ethnic groups staking out their own turf). Then, suddenly, the neighborhood erupts, as does Kowalski's long-dormant soul, and there's no turning back.<br /><br />Trying desperately to preserve his way of life, Kowalski comes to accept that America's future will have a whole new face to it. Those willing to keep America great may not look like the men who fought alongside him in Korea, but they must be armed with the tools they need to rebuild their neighborhood, city, and country. Sizing up the personal character of his young Hmong immigrant neighbor who ""doesn't have a chance"" in warding off the advances of Asian-on-Asian bullying, Kowalski seeks to provide, both literally and figuratively, the personal equipment that this new American needs to successfully assimilate. Just maybe, in the back of his mind, this aging, crusty ""Polack"" remembers that, despite all the ethnic jokes tossed around among his circle, immigration has always contributed to the next wave of growth in America.<br /><br />With his soul stirring, Kowalski finally takes Confession, but he leaves unstated the biggest sin of his life: killing other human beings. For the relatively innocuous sins that Kowalski proffers, he's asked to atone with some basic Catholic rituals. But Kowalski has another method of atonement in mind, one that, for someone who professes to be not in the least religious, manifests a very Christ-like demonstration of selflessness.<br /><br />By the time Kowalski devises his plan of individual and neighborhood salvation, he realizes that ""enemy"" and ""ally"" cannot be pidgeonholed into ethnic or territorial classifications, just as the meaning of ""family"" is no easy thing to define. He understands that the model of living that he has preserved for so long must be torn up and that he must recalibrate how he views the world for the good of his soul.<br /><br />""Gran Torino"" is at turns a humorous, poignant, and searing movie with pitch-perfect acting by Eastwood, and an earnest and endearing cast of novice supporting actors. It is destined to be a classic. Even the spate of foul language - which accurately reflects the tone and sound of the streets like Kowalski's all across America - does not diminish the significance of this work.<br /><br />This is a muscle car of a movie that idles in your mind.", 5.0
1864971,"Although MOONRAKER (1979) made a heap of money, the filmmakers of the James Bond film franchise wisely decided to bring our hero back to Earth this time.  It is surprising, though, that with all the commentary lauding  the return to Fleming, that the films directly after this one slowly but  surely drift away from Fleming yet again.  This could have been Roger  Moore's fnest Bond if not for the fatal flaw of the music.  I like some of  the score - the music during the pre-credits sequence meshes nicely with  the action.  But that discordant piano and rachets for the beginning of the  ski chase?  Bland TV-type music at best.  Thank God it is absent from the  soundtrack album.  Director John Glen's editing expertise stands him in  good stead in setting the pace, but no Bond film should be over two hours  long.  It must be Moore's languid delivery which adds to the length.  In  some scenes Moore looks old and in others he looks great, and all the  establishing shots expertly edited in with the stuntmen adds a great deal.  There is a freshness to FOR YOUR EYES ONLY that is important in setting the  tone for the Bond films of the 80s.

Nicole ( Kristen Dunst ) only wants to be loved, and for someone to accept her for who she is, I can relate to that. Eventually everyone wants to be loved. This movie is emotional at times. Sometimes love will take over, especially if the love is that great. Love can distract you from important things in life, but sometimes it doesn't matter. I lost my grandma recently, I can relate to Nicole, it's hard to lose your Mom like that it's very hard. I think love saved Nicole. Nicole always wanted her father to be there for her, but the relationship wasn't always that great. Nicole is going through a lot in her life, and she wants to be loved for who she is.

4201721,"One of the great satires of the early forties and one of director-writer Preston Sturges's most enjoyable films.  Famous movie director John L.  Sullivan (Joel McCrea), who has built his reputation with financially  successful comedies and musicals,  disguises himself as a bum in order to  see the real America.  His goal:  to soak up enough ""real life"" so he can  direct an epic screen tragedy, which his studio bosses are dead set  against.  On his way he meets a disillusioned actress (Veronica Lake) and a  host of other interesting and amusing characters.  What ensues is some of  the wittiest dialogue ever written served up by some of the best character  actors every assembled.  The chemistry between Lake and McCrea is most  believable, with Lake proving that she was a most gifted comic actress with  impeccable timing.  McCrea more than holds his own as the steadfast  Sullivan.  A wonderful slice of Americana and the fickleness of Hollywood,  which hasn't changed  much in the third millennium.", 5.0
7332656,"This political thriller, based on the novel by Frederick Forsyth, begins with a failed assassination attempt by the OAS, an organization angered by President DeGaulle's liberation of Algeria. They realize they are now under intense surveillance by French security and intelligence and must go outside France to hire a professional killer. His code name becomes Jackal. When the French kidnap and torture a member of the OAS, they get the word 'jackal' out of him before he dies. With that slim clue and Investigator Lebel they go to work to track down this apparent assassin. The film runs two parallel tracks between the French security forces and The Jackal, who always seems to be one step ahead. While the film covers in great detail the plans of The Jackal to carry out the perfect plot and the painstaking intelligence work on the part of the French government (before computers and cell phones), it never seems to bog down or be boring. It keeps you on the edge of your seat, building to the climactic 'Day of the Jackal' when DeGaulle is to be assassinated. You don't have to suspend logic to believe this film. It is based on the cleverness and genius of the assassin as well as the intuition and perseverance of Investigator Lebel. Both are obsessed with their jobs and are up to the challenge. A top notch thriller. Roger Ebert calls it 'spellbinding'. [...]", 5.0

1166929,"Eastwood's unadorned 'Baby' is a cinematic masterpiece<br /><br />""Million Dollar Baby"" arrives like an Olympian returning from the Games in a ticker-tape parade, draped in gold medals: seven Oscar nominations, two Golden Globes, countless awards from critics associations, and a place at the top of most top 10 lists.<br /><br />It's almost too much for such a modest movie to bear. Which is not to say that ""Million Dollar Baby"" is undeserving of the praise: It is one of three bona fide masterpieces Clint Eastwood has made, along with ""Unforgiven"" and ""Mystic River.""<br /><br />But it is so unadorned, so beautifully spare and old-fashioned in its storytelling, it deserves to be seen without hype and without expectations. Ideally, you would come across it by accident, late at night on a cable movie channel. That way, it could work its deceptive power, lulling you into thinking you're watching a small, straightforward boxing movie, when in fact you're watching a movie that quietly and movingly takes on all the Big Themes: life, death, family, love, faith, and what we owe to the people we love.<br /><br />It tells a story we think we've seen before, countless times: A scrappy young fighter shows up in the gym of a cynical, over-the-hill trainer, asking for a chance to be a contender. Yeah, yeah.<br /><br />Except this boxer is a woman, and at 31 she's not all that young. The trainer tells her she's too old, and anyway, he doesn't work with ""girlies.""<br /><br />But Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank) won't be dissuaded. She's paid for a membership to the Hit Pit, and she keeps showing up, day after day, working the heavy bag by herself in the corner. The gym manager, an old, one-eyed fighter named Scrap (Morgan Freeman), takes a shine to her and talks the cynical trainer, Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood), into taking her on.<br /><br />She's got something, Scrap says - and here is where the movie takes its first turn by acknowledging its boxing-movie stereotypes and cliches. Yeah, Frankie growls back, ""But heart isn't enough.""<br /><br />Don't let the growl fool you. Maggie sure doesn't. As it turns out, heart - that hardy bromide not only of sports movies but of showbiz movies - is the subject of this unassuming movie, and Eastwood takes his time examining the ones belonging to Scrap, Maggie and Frankie.<br /><br />Maggie, as Scrap tells us in his quiet, melancholy narration, is a hillbilly who ""always knew she was trash."" She's determined to escape her past through boxing, though the movie - which guards its secrets and leaves a lot unexplained - never reveals how she took up the sport. It just shows us her oddly polite ferocity, her childish delight in hitting people and knocking them down.<br /><br />Eastwood gallops through a series of her fights as she aims for the championship, and what's striking about Swank's fine performance is how much she tells us about Maggie through her boxing. There's no rage there: Swank, bulked up and buzzing with a joyful energy, locates in Maggie the same inarticulate desire for acceptance that she found in Teena Brandon in ""Boys Don't Cry.""<br /><br />At 74, Eastwood has honed his own performances to an almost Zen stillness: He embodies the less-is-more aesthetic, offsetting the big emotions of the script with his quiet gruffness. He has secrets, too - he has an estranged daughter, he goes to Mass every day only to quiz the priest with theological impertinence, he reads Yeats and studies Gaelic - and they have made him wary of connecting.<br /><br />The mellow Freeman (so memorable opposite Eastwood in ""Unforgiven"") is his perfect partner, coming in like a sax player in a jazz trio to add a mournful counterpoint to the main themes played by Eastwood and Swank. Eastwood adds a few side players, too: Maggie's trailer-trash mother (Margo Martindale) and her awful siblings, the gym rats, another manager who tries to steal Maggie from Frankie.<br /><br />""Million Dollar Baby"" comes from a collection of boxing short stories by F.X. Toole, the pseudonym of longtime boxing manager and corner man Jerry Boyd. But it in its clean, well-lighted eloquence, it has the feel of a story by Ernest Hemingway, a story that takes place in boxing rings and diners, about people who seek faith and redemption and love without being able to speak of it.<br /><br />As it builds toward its heartbreaking resolution, its apparent plainness becomes purity, its artlessness becomes art.", 5.0

And let me say that Ferris Bueller's Day Off is still pertinent, as well as enjoyable.<p>I've seen the ending numerous times on TV, but this very night  I decided to watch the whole thing.  I rented it with a friend and loved  it.  Tomorrow I will go out and buy the DVD.<p>John Hughes was one of the  precursors of such great writer-directors as Kevin Smith, and this film is  evidence.  It may have different focuses and some might find this difficult  to interpret, as some reviews have said.<p>I say &quot;Bull.&quot;  This  film captures high school.  Even if all the teachers aren't as boring, the  administration is still spreading the same lies that the principal  character does in the film.  He tries for authority and only pulls off  incompetence.<p>With humor, light youthful cynicism, and carefree but  intelligent views on life, I can attest to Ferris's own accuracy.  I may  not be as successful, but I see myself as a Buellerist(even if it wasn't  intended).<p>So what if the movie ends seriously?  That's what high school  is!  There're good times, hilarious times.  And then there's learning who  you are.  Coming to terms.  I was moved by Ferris Bueller's Day Off.  In a  world where accuracy often means disgusting, hack films like American Pie,  this movie captured school days masterfully.  Films that take the act of  growing up and make it a sick joke are insulting, in my opinion.  American  Pie featured the darker side of growing up.  People who are self-centered  and petty.  What a life, to start in such a way.  Ferris Bueller is shown  to be human and moral as he speaks about his friends, however.  His  analyses are wonderful, and caring while not being sugar-coated.  The film  was true but tasteful, succinctly and accurately showing the trials of  growing up.<p>It's over-the-top, but anyone who was interesting in high  school(and childhood in general), I'm sure, can attest to memories that  seem larger-than-life.  While it may be difficult to watch Ferris Bueller  run up slides and jump on trampolines all to get home with a serious eye,  one must admit that when one looks back at school, some things are like  that, even if only in your mind.<p>Ferris Bueller's Day Off works on levels  that only one who is or has been young can appreciate.", 5.0

2115343,"There are many who know who Mr. Bean is. There are some who may not. Both would be pleased to see a movie featuring this character that is suitable for the whole family.<br /><br />Actor Rowan Atkinson created the character of Mr. Bean for English television some time back. A hit overseas, the show became a staple much like Monty Python, winding up on PBS where enthusiastic viewers fell in love with the dimwitted character whose luck always seemed to turn out good.<br /><br />In MR. BEAN'S HOLIDAY, we find Mr. Bean the lucky winner of the church raffle for an all expenses paid trip to the French Riviera, including a camcorder to record his trip. But just like the TV show, no trip for someone like Mr. Bean could turn out normal.<br /><br />Along the way, Bean ends up accidentally separating a young boy and his father. To make amends, he attempts to help the two reunite. But again, we're talking Bean here, not a normal hero. The adventures of the pair as they try to make their way to Cannes where the boy's father is are hilarious. And all of them are captured on video as Bean shoots everything.<br /><br />Atkinson is a great physical comedian, but not in a pratfall sort of way. He is one to put to use his entire body in emoting and drawing out an idea on screen. Bean is a character who sees the world through child like eyes, who never realizes he's done something wrong until afterwards. And yet this innocence is what makes him so endearing.<br /><br />The idea of an Englishman stuck in France with no ability to speak the language helps rather than hinders the story. The strength of Atkinson's Mr. Bean has always been his physicality rather than wordplay and that strength if given a white canvas on which to paint with this set up.<br /><br />While the laughs might be as funny as some found in the original series, there are plenty on hand. And these are jokes and situations that young and old alike can find something to laugh at.<br /><br />Tolstoy it isn't but if you're looking for something to make you laugh, by all means give Mr. Bean a try. And once you get through this movie, check and see if the local video store has the series on hand as well. You'll be glad you did.", 3.0
480418,"When watching ""Remains of the Day,"" you never really get to see Emma Thompson and Anthony Hopkins show one another any real affection. In this movie, they actually have great chemistry and while Emma takes on the role of a much more subservient woman, she is much more radiant. If you are a fan of her acting, you will definitely want to see this movie.<br /><br />This is a movie which takes some patience to view and the artistic elements are well worth waiting for. The Schlegel sisters get themselves into a few trying situations and the men they love either fail miserably or protect them from the world.<br /><br />Margaret (Emma Thompson) is the smarter of the sisters and yet she lacks heart in certain situations. She seems quite happy to let others save her, but is not as willing to sacrifice to save a friend. Her sister falls in love with a young bank clerk and while trying to assist him is seduced and ""ruined."" She is not following the laws of her society and therefore is rejected at first.<br /><br />This is a tangled web involving the cultured and underprivileged. Margaret and Helen are independent and well educated and when they meet Leonard Bast (Samuel West) their lives are changed forever.<br /><br />A somewhat somber ending because we are not sure any of the characters really get what they first wanted. I found this movie to be enjoyable, yet felt tense throughout the movie because there is always the thought that the sisters have ruined an innocent. Leonard is really the tragic hero in this story because he took on a responsibility neglected by Mr. Wilcox who has his eye on Margaret.<br /><br />All I have to say is...""Don't let anyone steal your umbrella.""<br /><br />If you enjoy movies that make you think about more than what is happening on screen, this is a good movie that will make you contemplate the fate of others around you in your world. You could hold someone's destiny in your hands, even if it is not as dramatic as the story in this movie.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review", 4.0

7100572,"THE TOWN<br /><br />When this film was first released I was all kinds of excited since I am a huge Jeremy Renner and a Ben Affleck fan as well. Add in that not only do I like those two as actors but I thought Affleck's first film ""Gone Baby Gone"" was great. So needless to say that we [my little group of friends and such] really wanted to see this movie and were excited about it. Of course we loved it but I must say that this DVD/Blu-Ray combo pack is great with an extended version. Add in the behind the scenes features and you have one great combo pack.<br /><br />The story follows a group of Charlestown bank robbers as the FBI is looking into them after a recent successful heist. It turns out that while they did this they took a hostage and after letting her go they wonder if she will be a problem. So Doug MacRay [Affleck] takes on the responsibility of finding out what she knows, she won't recognize him because they robbers were wearing masks [of course]. But has the heat from the FBI increases and Doug's feelings for her grow the rest of the crew becomes restless. The problem being of course is has Doug falls for her he wants even more to get out of the game, but they have one more big job to do.<br /><br />I have to say that while some of not liked this as much as me I really enjoyed this film and found it to be very well done. I have to give Ben create because I really do like this film and as a writer/director he is really becoming a top guy I the business. As an actor I have always liked him, he has a certain charisma that shines through. Of course my boy Jeremy Renner was excellent in this film as James Coughlin, in fact if Bale had not won the best supporting actor award at the Oscars I would say it would have gone to this man. While he brings a nice intensity to the character I actually see the sympatric side of the character that a lesser actor may not have brought out.<br /><br />Rebecca Hall does a great job as Ben's love interest Claire and plays a very real character, very well done. Jon Hamm is the FBI guy after the crew and does an excellent job here as well as does every one in the film, very well cast and cast with actual residents of Charlestown. I would also like to point out that Renner spent all his time with actual bank robbers from Charlestown to get the character and the accent down right. Based on a novel called ""Prince of Thieves"" by Chuck Hogan Affleck has proven that even if he wants to leave acting he has a career in filmmaking.<br /><br />This is one of my favorite films and that may be because I have been following Renner's career since his first film but hey I enjoyed it.

6749403,"When it comes to this film, I am so utterly in the wrong demographics that I feel quite silly putting in my two cents' worth - but here it is, anyway. Sometimes you flip thru channels and stumble on a movie that you somehow end up seeing all the way thru. So, for me and WHAT A GIRL WANTS. Young Amanda Bynes has never really registered on my radar before, but it's hard not to get in her corner when you see her perky self go to work.<br /><br />Seems like nothing is original anymore. WHAT A GIRL WANTS has drawn comparisons to <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000209KMW"">The Princess Diaries (2-Disc Collectors Set)</a>, but apparently its roots go back further, to a 1958 comedy film THE RELUCTANT DEBUTANTE starring Rex Harrison and Sandra Dee, which in turn was adapted from a 1956 play of the same name by some cat named William Douglas Home. Cinderella, of course, is the grandmama of inspirations for movies like this.<br /><br />WHAT A GIRL WANTS is fluff fluffity fluff, but enjoyable and the sort of lighthearted, lightweight teen chick flick which the young girl audiences (and I guess, me) gobble up like M&Ms. There's even a touch of that girl-empowerment thing going on. But if you say you can't guess how the plot will play out, then pardon me but my bullcrap detector just exploded. The set-up goes like this: 17 years ago, a young British noble (Colin Firth) and a gorgeous, free-spirited American girl (Kelly Preston) meet and fall in love in Morocco and get married in a bedouin wedding ceremony. He takes her to his posh estates in England, only to have disapproving forces scheme to separate the two. She leaves in tears, he lets her leave. He doesn't know she's pregnant.<br /><br />Amanda Bynes plays New York teenager Daphne Reynolds who runs away from her single parent mother to seek out her Englishman dad in London. To catch us up, Daphne's father is now Lord Henry Dashwood, currently engaged to be married and a popular candidate in the upcoming elections (and he still doesn't know he has a daughter). So, as you may guess, Daphne's unexpected arrival introduces a wrench in the works, a fly in the ointment, a fart in the wind. Bring on the belles and balls and the anticipated father-daughter culture clash, as the rest of the movie tells of how plucky and sweet collide with repressed and snooty.<br /><br />What's a story like this, though, without a wicked social-climbing stepmummy or a conniving step-sister? There's even a dashing young Jack-of-all-trades to lend a hand to Daphne, as well as a kindly British grandmum who we sense from the start would have Daphne's back and who ends up with film's best line (that one about hugs). But the real connection is between Amanda Bynes and Colin Firth's daughter and dad characters. It's quite fun watching Daphne gradually begin to have an effect on her stiff upper-lipped father and seeing this portrait of restraint and decorum loosen up by inches. The film's high point for me may well be that scene with Lord Dashwood in tight leather pants playing air guitar in front of the mirror.<br /><br />Bonus features? The DVD offers the following: two sets of audio commentary, one by the film director and the screenwriters, the other by Amanda Bynes (for those preferring a more, like, youthful testimonial); ""Fashion and Etiquette 101"" - the film's costume designer Shay Cunliffe goes over the cast's wardrobe and etiquette instructor Maggie O'Farrill nags about the proprieties; ""What's A Girl To Wear?"" - a game requiring a good memory for Daphne's outfits (as a guy, I refuse to play this); 3 additonal scenes (totalling 1 minute 39 seconds); the theatrical trailer; and the film cast & crew credits.<br /><br />WHAT A GIRL WANTS pushes all the right feel-good buttons and rides on the talent and credibility of the cast. Amada Bynes demonstrates an unaffected, likeable quality, nicely balancing her goofy exuberance with pratfalls and even a dash of romance. With her, the stodgy Brits never really had a chance. Equally key is Colin Firth, pitch perfect as the impeccable, uncomfortable Lord Dashwood, who as the film progresses regains that inner cool he had back in his youth, when he listened to rock 'n roll and sported a more hip wardrobe. Firth manages to pull off being simultaneously reserved yet charming. Again. Having seen <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005MP58"">Pride and Prejudice - The Special Edition (A&E, 1996)</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JMFQ"">Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)</a>, I shouldn't be surprised. Kelly Preston is good as Libby, Daphne's beautiful Bohemian mom who raises Daphne to be carefree yet grounded; You could see why even after all these years Lord Dashwood still thinks of her. Libby is a wedding singer, which gives Preston a chance to actually sing the songs. She's not bad.<br /><br />Sappy last paragraph: This film may be tailored for the youngsters, but it doesn't necessarily snub the old fogies. When I told a buddy of mine that I'd seen this movie and liked it, he dismissed the film as fluff fluffity fluff. Obviously, I disagree. There's always a place for charming teen comedy flicks, not only in the hearts of young whippersnappers, but also in the wrinkled cockles of the decrepit. In its predictability and retelling of that same old message (be true to yourself), it doesn't insult our intelligence as much as reaffirm certain values. So I take back what I said about not being in this film's target demographics. With me, the film is apparently spot on.", 4.0

3061315,"This was, without a doubt, one of the best movies I have ever seen.  Saw a preview on TV one day and had to wait about 4 months for it to come to the theater.  Well worth the wait, I can say.<br />Everybody is offering their review, and thankfully, most are positive.  However, there was one particular scene that just had me.  It's when George, realizing his fame and fortune are near an end, and he is sitting in his living room looking out the window, and it's raining.  The camera angle has his face, and the raindrops that are falling down from the windows reflect on his face, and it looks as though he is crying.  Incredible!  This is what great filmmaking is all about.  I thought the acting was superb, and even the extras in the film were terrific.  When the dog has to run to the cop for help, notice the lady standing on the corner.  She reminds me of everybody's aunt, and she has that ""look"" about her that was just terrific.  Go see this wonderful film, and I, for one, cannot wait until it arrives at my home in a few weeks.  I will watch it over and over, because it's one of those rare, excellent films that allow you to savor them again and again.", 5.0

4571354,"The story of the Marquis de Sade, whose name is inextricably linked with the word ""sadism,"" comes alive in this absorbing but graphic depiction of 18th century attitudes toward love and sex, mental illness, religion, and crime and punishment in France.  Adapting his stageplay for the screen, author Doug Wright sets the action primarily in the Charenton asylum, where the Marquis de Sade occupied a lavish cell.  Philip Kaufman directs this noir film, which is filled with ironies and raises questions about who is sicker--the inmates or their wardens.<br /><br />Geoffrey Rush, nominated for an Academy Award as Best Actor, is a terrifying Marquis de Sade, showing his wild rages, cruelty, and self-destruction, but also his need for understanding and human contact. Obsessively writing pornographic novels from his cell, he has a laundress smuggle them out to a delighted public.  Dr. Royer-Collard, director of the asylum (sneeringly played by Michael Caine) is coldly formal, a believer in cruel punishment as a deterrent from abnormal behavior, his ""punishments"" rivaling anything the Marquis dreams up.<br /><br />Madeleine LeClerq (winningly played by Kate Winslet), a lively laundress with a sense of adventure, is intrigued by the Marquis and helps him, showing herself to be more human and less a caricature than most of the other characters.  Joachin Phoenix sensitively portrays the Abbe de Coulmier, a young priest who believes in the basic goodness of man, showing him as he agonizes over the conflicts between his church, his growing love for Madeleine, and his revulsion of Royer-Collard's perversities.<br /><br />This film is violent and graphic, with some nudity, but the screenplay is elegantly written, filled with observations which both illustrate and elevate its themes.  The dialogue is brilliant, though often more formal than one would expect of the inmates, conveying ideas at the same time that it accompanies violent action.  The cinematography (Rogier Stoffers), with its dark prison scenes and close-ups of blood, dismemberment, and torture (some of it self-mutilation), combined with the costuming (Jacqueline West), make the nether-world of Charenton come alive visually.<br /><br />Though the violence may be accurate and appropriate to the times, it is so pervasive and so graphic here that it seems to pander to an audience's baser emotions--it feels like a stage play given an extremely violent overlay for film.  Still, the cast is wonderful, the story is absorbing, and the themes--what is morality, and how, if at all, should society control it?--are fully explored and presented.  Mary Whipple", 4.0

After I watch, it is stunning.  For the acting, it is good.  Lindsay Lohan acts well and she rocks as Maggie Peyton.  Michael Keaton does well as her father (Ray Peyton Sr.).  For Matt Dillon, he is okay as a ""technically villain"" as Trip Murphy.  Also, I do like Beckin Meyer (as Ray Peyton Jr.) and Justin Long (as Kevin).  The funniest thing is before racing; those NASCAR racers acted a little bit like Jeff Gordon, Jimmie Johnson, Dale Jarrett and Tony Stewart (all as themselves).  This is a real surprise for me when they actually appear.  For the direction, well, it is good because every sequence is quite logical.  For the visuals, it is quite good because like shooting the car (the main thing in this movie), it is like a magic car to make it fancy.  For the music, it is quite okay.

3982110,"Extremely reminiscent of cold war sleepers like ""Gorky Park"" and ""Reds"", Gymkata is one of the most carefully scripted and brooding commentaries on American foreign policy during the Reagan years. The film is more like a documentary than a work of fiction in its deep attention to historical accuracies and avoidance of hyperbole.<br /><br />Robert Clouse's directorial adaption of Dan Tyler Moore's Pulitzer-shortlisted novel manages to capture timbre of the times and the voice of the decade in a script of intricate complexity.  Kurt Thomas's portrayal of the hero across from Tetchie Agbayani's heroine is one of the most dynamic and surprising chemistries since Bogart and Bergman's 43 years before.<br /><br />However, where ""Casablanca"" fell far short of documenting the spirit (and fears) of the times on a granular level, Gymkata and its cast is unafraid to take this plunge.<br /><br />In characterizations deeply respectful, and yet photo-accurate, regarding world cultures and global motifs, Gymkata manages spell the poly-sided views of complex conflicts that occurred during the final grey gasps of the Cold War.<br /><br />Amazingly Gymkata manages a foreshadowing the rise of the Neo-Cons some 20 years later in its depictions of the United States use of aggression in strategically important hotspot regions -- and as well -- the film is able to show that the nationalistic concerns of the competing sovreignties (both ally & foe) remain unchanged despite which decade these events play themselves out in.<br /><br />A timeless film, Gymkata should be a core film study in every graduate level political science class.", 5.0

1650650,This is not a perfect Christmas movie by any means PERIOD.<br /><br />The pros: The snow and all the christmas stuff and atmosphere is cute charming and puts you in the holiday spirit.<br /><br />The main characters sudden change at the end was too convenient and the sad story at the end thats meant to touch us seems forced and just thrown up there to tie all the loose ends of the film.<br /><br />Granted yes when I originally watched it it made me tear up because I thought it was sweet.My father died in July and this was one of his favorite Christmas movies so I will probably tear up again at that part just because... I miss him and know he enjoyed this movie.<br /><br />The humor and slapstick in the movie was so so it was extremely forced and strained and unfortunately this was easy to spot which ruined the so called comedy of the movie immediately.<br /><br />I felt like I was forcing myself to even chuckle during this movie when I first saw it on Dvd back in 2005 .<br /><br />The acting from almost everyone involved is horrible Tim Allen and Jamie Lee Curtis were not that bad but they seemed to be zombies just reading their lines through half the movie.Jamie Lee Curtis characters screaming also got extremely annoying irritating and aggravating after a while talk about OVERACTING to the point of no return.<br /><br />Tim Allens character as usual like in most of his movies tries way too hard to be funny and its not convincing or interesting for the most part unfortunately.<br /><br />The supporting characters an annoying whiny kid 2 idiotic cops who add nothing to the movie whatsoever a daughter who changes her mind at the last minute and decides to come home for Christmas with her good looking boyfriend. 2 friends of Jamie Lee Curtises you only see 2 freaking times throughout the movie neighbors that are so grating you'd want to punch them all out and a MAYOR with the most annoying monotone voice ever heard and as intimidating as a pussy cat would be.<br /><br />The only neighbors that are nowhere near as annoying are the kindly elderly woman and her husband dealing with health issues .They were pretty much the only REAL characters worth sympathizing or caring about period.<br /><br />Oh I forgot a ridiculous part of the movie revolves around a petty robber that adds nothing to the movie whatsoever AGAIN and a MYSTERIOUS stranger who offers the main character an umbrella at the beginning of the movie.With this being a Christmas movie and all I am sure people can guess who he turns out to be in the end.I loved the snow the christmas decorations but the story itself was ridiculous and the lengths these insane neighbors go to is extremely stupid and not even the least bit believeable either., 3.0
7817820,"As a child, future director Paul Verhoven's playground was the recently bombed out homes of his neighbors. The absurd violence in the world seems to be reflected in all his movies. I have been involved with four Verhoven films while on the Rob Bottin effects crew. Verhoven made a name for himself directing the edgy and funny &quot;Robocop&quot; originally receiving an X-Rating for the violence in his director's cut. Total Recall and Starship Troopers are other wild examples of his romance with ultra violence. He has always made films that push limits of acceptable social boundaries. Before he directed Showgirls he tested the public's tolerance for a sex with buckets of blood with his thriller Basic Instinct.<br />  Basic Instinct is a Hitchcock style murder thriller featuring Sharon Stone who is &quot;dressed to kill&quot; as famous author Catherine Trammel (a dead ringer for Kim Novak in Vertigo) A violent icepick murder seems to have been taken right out of her recent novel. Arrogant and cool, she actually invites the police investigators to wonder if she did it in the now legendary interogation scene where she crosses her legs and shoots Detective Curran (Michael Douglas) an eyeful of her unpantied intimate territory. Curran is investigates her a little too closely and compromises his integrity by getting ensnared in her sexual web. Did she do it or is it the copycat work of a crazed fan? Even intimately close to the suspect Detective Curran doesn't really know for sure.<br />Even though this is the unrated director's cut you won't find some of the most extremely gory footage. Stone shot a scene in the nude where she straddled a realistic torso of a victim  repeatedly plunging the icepick into the chest and face. Splattered with fake blood and feeling in her arm the sensation of the pick piercing this rubbery body, the illusion was all too real. Sharon became nauseous and had to leave the set. Also missing Gus (George Dzunza) takes a nasty icepick in the cheek. Basic Instinct is a stylish and dark film that can be frustrating and uncomfortable as it never quite fully allows you to know all its secrets. But it is intriguing none-the-less.<br /> Personally I was always uneasy with the boundaries Verhoven likes to push but this is a better film than expected. Verhoven has had several unfulfilled dreams to push even harder but so far has been thwarted. For example &quot;Crusade&quot; Another Arnold movie quashed in negotiations &quot;Crusades&quot; had a scene where Scharzenneger is found with his head sticking out of the backside of a donkey's rear end. Verhoven often joked with Rob Bottin about making a film designed to enrage his critics called Jesus 2000. Rob thinks he would have seriously done it if he was given the money.<br />  Overall if you are a fan of Basic Instinct there is a lot for you on this disc. Two commentaries. One by Verhoven and the other by a feminist author as well as deleted scenes and some behind the scenes featurettes. The novelty plastic case with plastic ice pick was probably a bad idea as the hinges break very easily. Be careful when opening or you will be pretty ticked off.", 4.0
3544149,"When was the last time you felt the hairs stand up on your arms as you watched a film?  This radiant, measured drama, with a stubborn, diffident and magnetic performance by Mary Steenburgen, does it for me every time.  Telling the story of writer Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings and her sojurn in rural Florida in the 20's, it paints (and for once &quot;paints&quot; is the right verb) an eloquent portrait of the artist-as-not-always-likeable person, and also conveys an overwhleming sense of place and community.  Martin Ritt's great feeling for ordinary people breathes extraordinary life into this material, and the location settings and photography are superb.  Also superb are the supporting performances, including the acclaimed pairing of Rip Torn and the late, astonishing child actor Dana Hill as father and daughter.  But my personal favorite is Alfre Woodard's all-out, headlong portrayal of Geechee, Rawling's devoted, wild woman housekeeper.  This is the only film I know that conveys a real sense of the writer's life, and without pretense at that.  As for the raising of the hairs, there is nothing else in film to compare with the final lyrical montage that concludes the picture.  As Steenburgen speaks words from the text of Rawling's original &quot;Cross Creek,&quot; Ritt gives us image after ravishing image of Cross Creek and environs.  Once seen, you will never forget it.  The DVD is beautifully produced.  A treasure.", 5.0
2727279,"You'll be creeped out, have your heart broke, and have it mended, all in one hour and a half. Well, maybe not, but if you're like me you will!<br />All I really knew going into this movie was that it was Spanish, and that that kid with the sack on his head scared the crap out of me! So I was pretty prepared for the scary stuff, but didn't think the movie would be so moving as well. In a way, it's not so much a horror movie, as it is a movie about dealing with loss. Don't get me wrong, there's a lot of creepy moments in the movie...just not as much as your average everyday horror movie. Most the scary moments are due to atmosphere and tension as opposed to jump scares. So if you like the monsters popping out at you, you'll be bummed out. But if a sense of impending dread is something you enjoy, I think you'll dig the movie.<br /><br />The movie's basic plot is this; A woman was an orphan, and moves back into her childhood orphanage as an adult in hopes to reopen it. Her husband and son move in as well, and her son begins to gain more and more imaginary friends. Where it goes from there, I will not say, but it's not always what you expect. I don't think it's much of a spoiler to say that the son goes missing, and from there the movie become much more of a psychological study of loss...and a rather good one at that.<br /><br />The conclusion of the movie wasn't quite what I expected, but that's a good thing. The Orphanage is really a beautiful take of the classic Peter Pan story, and a movie I look forward to visiting again!<br /><br />The movie is also beautiful on BluRay and a very nice upgrade from the DVD.", 5.0

Enter Lt. Ellen Ripley. The brave  heroine we  all admired for her unwillingness to conform to the evils of mainstream  society and corporate cunning is  stuck with a band of mercenaries on a  military ship bound for earth. Because of the fact an alien was inside  Ripley when she died, she has been brought back not entirely as a human,  but rather a strange and unnerving new breed of human who's bloodlines have  crisscrossed with that of the legendary, acid toting, super strength  Grendel of a creature. The military team has secretly made a deal with the  mercenaries to spawn these creatures on a mass level. The film begins to  take on its familiar feel when the plan goes awry and the mercenaries are  left with no choice but to fend off  the creatures who are killing everyone  on the ship one by one. This film is nothing more than a combination its  first three predecessors.  Every element of the past films are easily  detected here and the only thing that is worse than seeing a repeat of a  movie you've already viewed is seeing a bad movie in itself. For all the  love I have for the previous three films in the series, I have to admit  that I have rarely seen a movie that so lacks a plot and moves with such a  blurr. I am especially surprised that this film is the work of French  director Jean Pierre Jeunet, who otherwise has woven works of genius and  stunning originality ( City Of Lost Children, Delicatessen).

Personally i think Brandon Routh did his best to portray a character that diehard and may I say fanatical people will always associate with Christopher Reeve, Reeve did his version I say give Routh the chance to step up to the challenge and not be forever in Reeve's shadow.<br /><br />As for Lois Lane, horrible the casting was bad , enough said.  Kevin Spacey is a great actor , no denying that, but Luthor needs a little more than being dark and sarcastic, he needs that kind of presence that makes you believe this guy would smile in your face as he chokes the life out of you, like Hackman did so well. Obviously the flying scenes were pretty good, with the help of CGI you could believe this guy was flying around Metropolis.

2173858,"LONESOME, while containing a couple of sequences that contain dialogue, should really be considered a silent film.  The silent sequences, as well as the innovative camera work which evokes the experimental techniques employed in German cinema, is what makes this film work and elevates is above many of the films of the era.<br />The premise of the film centers on a lonesome man and an equally lonesome woman who meet at Coney Island and make a connection. What might be a blissful moment of discovery is interrupted by a roller coaster fire when the pair are separated. Interspersed with scenes from chaotic urban existence, dream sequences, and the momentary respite at the beach, are interesting camera angles. The film also includes color sequences.<br />Visually this film is a delight and it tells a story with minimal dialogue (I.e., dialogue cards). As interesting as Sunrise was visually, it pales in comparison to Lonesome. The camera work is not only interesting but really quite advanced for its time. For me, the photography is a large part of the story because it sets the mood and tone of the picture as it progresses. The only negative is the amateurish rendering of dialogue in the talking sequences. The inclusion of dialogue was no doubt a tip of the hat to the new technology which would quickly overtake the industry, but it was more irritating than constructive in terms of storytelling. I would have preferred it if they hadn't included the three talking sequences and just left the movie alone when it was remastered.<br />Also included in this set are director Paul Fejos' musical Broadway as well as The Last Performance with the awesome  Conrad Viedt and screen vixen Evelyn Brent.

Don't mess with Karma, Death, Life, Destiny, Faith whatever else goes in that category.<br /><br />Two what i thought of the movies:<br />Final Destination: For sure is my favorite out of the four. I have always been a fan of Devon Sawa. I felt like the effects were done just right. It kept me guessing through the whole movie and the ending was great, made me so excited to see the next one.<br /><br />Final Destination 2: I was having trouble playing this one in my DVD. It wouldn't bring me to the menu to play the movie. It would just get stuck after the animation of the logo. I tried it on my laptop and it went past the animation and to the previews to the main menu. So put it back in my DVD player and just somehow got it to go to the end where its the extra features are and than just went to the menu and playing it from there...it annoyed me so much. But the movie itself wasn't a bad add on to the first movie I thought it went well just going on with the story from where it left off. effects were good as well.<br /><br />Final Destination 3: This is where I don't know if they should have stopped these after this one or before. I'm already not a fan of roller coasters or tanning beds and this one really makes me want to stay away from those two things for sure! The story was pretty good but at this point I was thinking this is stupid...not the story. By itself it handled its own but for as the whole package, you tend to know whats coming or think yea i seen this before, you people are funny thinking you could stop this. I liked how they used the pictures as on who's next on the list..that was pretty cool. I think they could have stopped after the second one and have this one as a totally different movie and named it something else actually.<br /><br />The Final Destination aka (4): UGH this is the one i enjoyed the least. I liked the things he saw and how they did that but the effects at the beginning with the race and them getting crashed by the ceiling it was like yea that was definitely made by a computer. The part I dug was the mechanic getting slammed against the fence so hard that it cut him all the way through and the diamond shaped chunk of body falls off! I felt like the acting was definitely worse of the four, i wanted to smack every one of them for their ""stupidity"" thats how their acting felt like they had no talent and didn't convince me of anything.<br /><br />Three im annoyed that there is a fifth one. You say final but yet you change your darn mind and make another (GRR!) Not going to lie I will probably watch it, but I'm pretty sure everyone already knows what's going to happen and just like all other sagas it just keeps getting worse and worse as the number of movie gets higher. Only movies that I havent felt a saga sucking after the first two is <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002R3G912"">SAW Complete Horror Collection DVD BOX 1.2.3.4.5 Unrated, Uncut I-V</a><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00303GT3Q"">Saw VI (Rated Full Screen Edition)</a><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003Q6D27S"">Saw: The Final Chapter</a>...I love Saw &lt;3!

The visuals are incredibly beautiful, the story was very engaging, and there's tons of action. Some of the scenes can seem somewhat silly, but as long as you realize that this is a fantasy film and let yourself be immersed in this fantasy world, you will enjoy it.

5191805,"I really wanted to like this film because of the actors involved in it. James McAvoy,who was excellent in ""The Last King of Scotland"" & ""Narnia"", Keira Knightly, and Vanessa Redgrave were the lures here plus the film had received excellent reviews.  However, the direction was plodding and that was a big surprise to me because I had liked Joe Wright's direction in the previous film to this, ""Pride & Prejudice"" also with Keira Knightley.  Because of this and despite McAvoy's and Redgrave's excellent acting, I felt disengaged from the film.  Also Knightley somehow lacks that ""something"" that made the late Audrey Hepburn magnetic and so I felt little of McAvoy's passion for her because of this. So regretfully, 2 stars which means okay but no bonnets for this very over-rated film (check out ""The French Lieutenant's Woman"" for comparison).", 2.0
5879306,"What do you expect to see in a movie?<p>As a movie made by Taiwanese, who are influenced by both the traditional Chinese culture and modern Western civilization, Yi Yi is not an ordinary one. It is a film about nothing since you cannot even tell what exactly the story is in a few words. It is, however, also a movie about everything of human life because it does touch many aspects of our experience: the attitude toward the career, fortune, family, lover and the ultimate faith of the life. Yi Yi explores the questions you and I might encounter in our daily life, but it also leaves no simple, miracle solution to them, just like that there is no easy answer to the real problem in this real world. <p>If you think a movie should tell a simple story which leads to a sure answer, you probably will not like Yi Yi. If you expect to see an exotic oriental fantasy, you definitely will feel bored and hate it. On the other hand, if you appreciate that a film merely depicts the happiness and the sadness from the routin life and catches the subtle emotions, you should see this one. You might also feel surprised about the similarity between a modern Asian city and the western world. <p>Probably you had better not raise your expectation too high before you see it, but you might feel satisfied with how richness Yi Yi could bring to you at the end.", 5.0
332205,"This was one of the first DVDs I got, for a reason. I love this movie -- it has energy and panache, not to mention some absolutely fabulous music. As I'm sure some blurb somewhere on this Amazon page mentions, the story concerns two blues-singing brothers who are trying to raise money for a good cause. Along the way, they interact with a ton of interesting people (including Carrie Fisher, Frank Oz, Aretha Franklin, and others), perform a lot of great blues, and destroy a lot of property. Mayhem and hilarity seem to thicken around the two leads, whose chemistry is undeniable. The movie feels nothing like some SNL folks' movies can feel -- it's a movie, with depth. I had no idea the Blues Brothers were a sketch originally!<p>Since I probably just told you a bunch of stuff you already knew, I'll step along to the DVD itself. Those who already own the movie on VHS might want to consider this addition to their DVD library -- the goodies are lots of fun, including an extensive ""making of"" feature.", 5.0

You see, hear and feel the effort that goes into every stroke of their wings as the birds make their way from migratory start to finish. And there are spectacular  moments of serendipity, such as the decoy scene. All these elements equal outstanding filmmaking. The movie stirs the conscience and conscious, too, helping us realize we MUST care for our environment and the creatures with whom we share this planet, without beating us over the head with a zealous ecological message.<br />  The soundtrack at times lifts you with the birds, and at times is little more than repetetive Euro-pop trash; however, the images on-screen draw your attention more than the music. The narration is sparse and not overdrawn. The concluding song has a haunting beauty that makes me mist over even as I recall it.<br />  The specs and features listed promise an excellent DVD product. I could watch this film over and over again, and I look forward to owning it on an excellent medium. If you love our earth and the winged marvels with whom we share it, you will love this movie.

6529605,"I'll be picking up my boxed set this weekend, but really, I'm not buying this for the extras, although they need more mention.  This is just a review of the tv series from my PoV.  Total rating is 4.5 stars.<br /><br />This type of show really is character-driven as opposed to plot-driven; the point is to get to know these characters as opposed to doing a ""villian of the week"" show like ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"".  Yes, there was the plot device of ""New York City is in danger!"", but each week was really about the characters and getting to know them.  So that's my focus.  The characters were brilliantly played.  Unlike many fans of the show, I actually found Nathan and Nikki to be my faves.  Adrian Pasdar is an excellent and really underrated actor who brought a different side to the show.  While everyone was in love with Peter and Hiro's joy of being superpowered, and everyone related to the high school angst of Claire's outsider status, I think Nathan represented the adult whose life has just been given the major upheaval by, well, life. He was a needed character, and Adrian Pasdar was a great casting decision.  Nikki was an interesting twist as a character.  I like Ari Lightner, but I wasn't 100% sure what the character was all about.  Once I learned more about her, I really liked her.  The split personality worked for me, but I'm glad it got integrated by the end of the season.  And lest I forget, Matt.  Matt, to me, also made some very interesting decisions throughout the season, and I wonder what the fallout will be in September.  He took a turn which I dind't see coming, but am not surprised with.  It was needed to keep him interesting.  Hiro, Claire, Isaac, DL, Peter... they were all great characters.  Skylar was an excellent villian, and HRG was certainly a character who provided endless hours of speculation.  It's going to be interesting to see what the show does next season.  Are Peter and Nathan dead?  What about Ando now that Hiro is in feudal Japan?  Is Matt among the living?  Is Sylar alive?  And what about Kirsten Bell, Dania Ramirez, and Nichelle Nichols, all brilliant casting decision for characters to come.<br /><br />The camoes and guest characters provided some great plot development, especially for Matt... let's face it, telepaths are boring, so he needed a good story.  And Clea DuVall, one of the most underrated actresses around, gave it to him.  The Invisible Man, George Takei, Eden, and all the others served good purposes, weren't just cannon fodder, and I wanted them all to join the cast!<br /><br />Half a star deduction for:<br />-the finale.  It was overall great, but it needed to be longer.  The ""climactic battle"" was anything but.  It reminded me of the bad flick that was ""Generation X"" staring Finola Hughes and based on the Marvel Comic of the same name.  It was really campy and hokey by the end.  I wanted it to be better.<br />-The decision by NBC to ""unout"" Claire's buddy Zach, then write him off the show.  I see a lot of people pleased with the racially diverse cast, and I agree, but to have a fake myspace page for the kid listing him as ""questioning"" and then redo everyone's memories and make him straight then get rid of him was a very poor decision by NBC, IMO.  Gay kids deserve role models, too, you know.<br />- They hype.  I think the fault really should be laid at the feet of the NBC PR crew.  THEY made the ads.  NBC missed the mark a few times with marketing.  Not the show.  But it does factor into my decion to give this a 4.5 star review marked by four instead of five stars.  The show needs to deliver, and there were times it didn't.  I loved the arcs, and ""Save the Cheerleader"", ""Are You on the List"" and the other marketing campaigns were great.  Except that they were usually a week or two ahead of the actual episode which was aired.<br /><br />Do I recommend this show, of course.  It's quality television.  Overall very well written and acted, and it's something you could sit down with the kids and watch without worry.  There were a few ""gross out"" scenes, usually involving Claire and Sylar, which may scare younger viewers, but it's something I'd let my niecesd and nephews watch.  Minimal swearing, not in-your-face, over the top and constant sexuality, simulated comic-book-esque violence make this a show for most viewers.<br /><br />Most of the 2006 season hasn't graduated.  Really, what are the real carry overs?  Oh, right, NBC's ""Heroes"" and ABC's ""Ugly Betty"".  That's really it.  For all the bad reviews of the show, the numbers and survivial and overall critical and fan acclaim speak for themselves.  And just because I can't resist, ignore the haters.  ""Lost"" fans are disgruntled because this season fell apart, and ""Battlestar Glactica"" fans are annoyed fanboys whose favorite show will never get picked up by a major network and they're just jealous of the commercial and critical success this show has pulled off.  ;)", 4.0

Unlike the other reviewers, I did not find it that complex if you understood the symbolism in the story and felt that it was very well put together and had great images.  With so much trash out there where the major movie houses just keep repeating the same themes / ideas / movies over and over, it is wonderfully refreshing to have thought provoking and unique films such as The Fountain to foster and support creativity in ideas and presentation.  This film is well worth $0.99 to rent, but it is an emotional film so if you are in the mood for a comedy or mindless action film you should probably look elsewhere...  Enjoy!  I did!", 5.0

Often cited as one of the worst films of all times, the compliment is certainly well deserved!

5778472,"This review is for the unrated extended blu-ray version. Plenty of spoilers so read at your own discretion. Although, my expectations for this movie were pretty low to begin with, since the movie wasn't directed by James Cameron and T3 wasn't as good as T2, I was at least expecting something that would extend the terminator storyline and mythology from the television show The Sarah Connor Chronicles (which was an excellent TV series) and from the comics. Unfortunately, the people who wrote the script for this movie and the director, McG are completely ignorant and clueless when it comes to the entire Terminator canon. Nothing in this movie makes any sense when you consider the previous three films. It's like these people just threw out everything from the first three films and then started making up stuff as they went along without any thought into what came before or the history that Cameron created.<br /><br />First, in this movie the machines all know who John Connor is which makes no sense if you follow the history. The audience is so used to the idea that Skynet knows all about Connor that this error usually passes over them without any thought, but what they forget is that only the machines from the future know who Connor is and only because of what he WILL accomplish in the future. He hasn't done ANYTHING yet. All the terminators from the previous films were from the future while the machines in this movie are in the present. The machines have just wiped out most of humanity and now sees them nothing more than a bunch of insects to finish exterminating. Connor at this point is just another insect so this idea that he is somehow important to them is ludicrous. Don't give me this crap about him being seen as a prophecy or messiah either.<br /><br />Second mistake is that the machines all know who Kyle Reese is which provides one of the biggest plot holes in this movie and goes against even common sense. The entire purpose of the first movie was that the machines didn't know who the father was so their only alternative was to terminate the mother which is why they built the damn time machine in the first place, in order to wipe out his entire existence. In fact information about the father was so secretive that not even Kyle Reese knew it. If the machines know who Kyle Reese is then why the hell would they even bother building the time machine when Connor's very existence depends on it? How the hell are they going to explain that in future sequels if there will be one? This is a massive disaster of a plot hole that can't be overlooked and can't be explained. It's idiotic. And don't give me this crap about alternate timelines or other theories on time travel that's different from the one used in Back to the Future. The rules of time travel and the theory used from the first trilogy have already been in place which is the Back to the Future scenario so you just don't make up new rules and change the canon to suit your logic. That's similar to that idiotic scene from AVP Requiem when the Predalien lays eggs inside pregnant women for the sole purpose of increasing the alien infestation. Only the damn queen lays eggs, stupid! And that still wouldn't explain why Skynet builds the time machine in the future either!<br /><br />Third plothole is when Skynet captures Kyle Reese they don't decide to execute him right then and there but instead have some kind of elaborate plot in order to lure Connor to execute him. Does this make any sense? What the hell was McG (what the hell kind of name is this) and the writers thinking when they came to this scene? Forget about your stupid theories on time travel when you can't apply it here (see second plot hole). This is so blatantly stupid that words can't describe the idiocy behind it. Who writes this stuff and not see the inherent problems with it?<br /><br />Fourth problem was when Connor arrives the T800, instead of breaking Connor's neck decides to play ball with him by throwing him around. I thought T800s have detailed files on human anatomy and how to efficiently terminate humans. You'd think that having their biggest sought out target within their grasp they'd kill him as quickly as possible and with a gun instead of a naked unarmed Arnold.<br /><br />Fifth problem comes at the end when they need to do a heart transplant on John, using Marcus's heart. This scene was supposedly changed due to leakage of the original script but it still doesn't excuse it's sloppiness. This scene requires that Marcus is an acceptable donor, plenty of immunosuppressive drugs, a heart surgeon and a team of anesthetics and not a veterinarian, and a sterile environment instead of the open desert. I was cringing at this scene and thank God it didn't last very long.<br /><br />Now as for the movie itself, if you are completely ignorant of the previous three films this movie would be somewhat entertaining for the action scenes alone which were very thrilling. But the audience doesn't really care about any of the characters except for maybe Marcus so the movie become nothing more than one action set piece after another. There's really no character development or insight into who these people are and why we should care about them. What made T2 and other movies like it so successful is that we get to know the characters where the audience have an emotional investment so we are concerned about them and anxiously curious about what will happen next. The action is there to supplant the characters not drive them. This movie should have been about how John Connor becomes leader of the Resistance and help humanity come back from the brink of extinction instead of this goofball storyline filled with plot holes. I won't bother going into the special features on the blu-ray or the deleted scenes which have already been discussed. I'll just add that the video transfer is impeccable and the audio is excellent as well and is what is expected from blu-ray by now.<br /><br />In conclusion, if you are expecting forgetful mindless action, explosions with killer robots, and don't necessarily care about character development or plot then this movie is adequate. But if you are a fan of the terminator franchise then you will be sorely disappointed from the glaring plot holes, mistakes, and literal lack of respect for the mythology and the fan base. It's comparable to George Lucas using midichlorians to explain the Force. Much like having top tiered actors in The Phantom Menace, not even Christian Bale aka Batman can save this turkey. Time to terminate this franchise or return it back to Cameron.", 2.0

5061854,"I just watched ""Thumbsucker"" and I know what you're thinking. You're thinking that a movie about a 17 year old kid that sucks his thumb would be really awkward to watch. But actually... Okay you're right. Watching a 17 year old kid suck his thumb is a little weird. But the thumb sucking part doesn't really last too long. The movie is about Justin Cobb (Played by a very good Lou Taylor Pucci.) and his journey through his last year of high school. There are girls, there are drugs, there's a debate team and there's even a (Slightly creepy.) orthodontist played by Keanu Reeves. And if this sounds like sort of standard teen-angst independent movie fair, well, that's because it's sort of standard teen-angst independent movie fair. It is, however, well written, well shot, nicely edited and boasts an outstanding cast. Vincent D'Onorfio (Didn't know the name but recognized the face.) and Tilda Swinton (Who's always good.) are great as Justin's parents and Vince Vaughn does a very solid, understated turn as the teacher who leads the debate team. (I would also mention that Kelli Garner is very sexy as the girl Justin has a crush on but since she's playing 17 and I'm a middle aged man it would be kind of creepy. So I'm just going to let it go.) So all in all? This is pretty good movie.", 4.0
6588617,"Let me tell you why some Americans hate this film. You see, this is a Chinese film. That's right, a film made in that not-a-democracy China. What's worse, it's a communist country, and an Asian one at that! Now most Americans can't read Chinese, can't speak Chinese, know diddly squat about China, and haven't been to China (or anywhere outside of their counties, for that matter). But they will knock anything Chinese! They simply hate China for reasons they don't even understand.<br /><br />I have lived in the US for 14 years, and I can tell you this: more than 80% of Americans are an uninformed, propaganda-driven herd.<br /><br />Regardless of the origin of the film, I submit that sacrifice for the greater good is a noble cause in any culture. Yet you see many Americans (and Brits, Aussies) doggedly obsess over the fact that the film is made in a communist country and the message is a communist one. Load of crap. It's only an excuse. Deep down, they hate the film because of their blind hatred for China and disdain for all things Asian. Take, for example, Braveheart, a historically based fiction well-received in the US which extols the heroism of William Wallace. Supposedly Willie fights and dies for Freedom. But does he die for his freedom to go shop at WalMart anytime he desires? No. Willie is a ""hero"" because his cause is (supposedly) freedom for Scotland. (Of course, his fight doesn't really start until his woman is slain, and he gets into big big trouble with the Brits.)  In any case, the theme is sacrifice for the greater good. Americans foam in the mouth praising this film. But if sacrifice for the greater good is communist ideology, isn't it evil?<br /><br />Hero is not completely historically accurate, but which Hollywood flick is?  Hero is simply a story well told, and told with astounding visual beauty.  It's great entertainment, and in that respect it's nearly perfect.<br /><br />PS.  For those of you who can't speak Chinese, the English translation in this movie is reasonably good, although some emotion and power of the Chinese language is lost in the process.  Certain things simply sound lame when expressed in English (this goes both ways, of course).  However, there is a major mis-translation.  The two words written by Broken Sword actually means ""all under heaven,"" not ""our land.""  Not even close.  But then, it's simply impossible to translate some things faithfully from Chinese into English, without making it sound tacky.", 5.0

When a role is overacted from the beginning of a file, the viewer tends to spend the rest of the film picking it apart.  I confess, I had to reel myself in, because I started to do the exact same thing, but then I reminded myself (as I always do) that it is a movie, and it's sole purpose is to entertain....<br /><br />Overall, it is an enjoyable film and I would recommend it to those who enjoyed other films such as, The Family Stone, Rumor Has It, Monster In Law etc.....", 4.0

But before there were Fargo and Academy Awards, there was The Big Lebowski, which for actor Jeff Bridges is his signature career role, The Dude.<br /><br />The plot is a LA, Raymond Chandler style mystery; it's hard to tell the bad guys and femme fatales without a scorecard.<br /><br />The similarities stop there.  Dude is a middle aged longhaired, hippy slacker with a bowling ball. His pal John Goodman is a Vietnam freak-out converted to Judaism.

3517122,"The film includes three main story lines: a naïve Angel of Death (Brad Pitt) first experiences with simple pleasures such as peanut butter, his chosen guide's attempts to keep his business based on the principles on which he founded it, while coming to terms with his own mortality, and a romance between ""Joe Black"" and his guide's daughter, Susan (Claire Forlani). It includes a large quantity of profane language and several emotional themes.<br /><br />The movie opens with an introduction to the guide, Bill Parrish (Anthony Hopkins), who doubts that he will live for many more years. Indeed, he is approached in his home and work by what he thinks are hallucinations, wherein Death himself has come with the intention of escorting him to the afterlife.<br /><br />Bill, touched by his dream-like brush with mortality, expresses his desire for his daughter, Susan, to live a life with passion. She is considering marriage, but her father is not favorably impressed by her relationship. When she asks for the short version of his impassioned speech, he simply says, ""Stay open. Who knows? Lightning could strike!"".<br /><br />Shortly after hearing this advice, Susan meets a vibrant young man of whom she is instantly enamored. Immediately after this encounter, the man dies of collision with two cars. Death returns to Bill's home in the form of the young man, explaining that his impassioned speech has piqued his (Death's) interest after an eternity of boredom. Given Bill's ""competence, experience, and wisdom"", Death has chosen him and tells Bill that in return for an extended lifetime, Bill shall be his guide on Earth. Notably, during his time on Earth, Death's personality alters to become mildly curious, ruminative, and gentle, having been worldly, sardonic, and arrogant until he reveals his appearance.<br /><br />Death then places himself at Bill's right hand, under the name 'Joe Black', and establishes his place in Bill's home and work, instructing Bill to reveal his identity to nobody. This last task is complicated when the Board of Directors of Bill's corporation are urging a union with a larger company at the instigation of Susan's fianc&eacute;e, Drew (Jake Weber). After a tense Board meeting wherein Bill advises the Board against the merger, Joe ventures into the city to explore it. He visits the hospital where Susan works as a doctor to see her and in doing so, observes the human aspect of mortality, which was apparently unknown to him. A dying Guyanese patient recognizes him as a spirit; upon learning that he is Death, she asks to be taken to the afterlife. Joe instead soothes her pain and promises to take her later.<br /><br />He returns to visit Bill, who describes his late wife, to whom he was strongly attached. Their conversation is interrupted by Drew, who is bothered by the reversal of Bill's decision regarding the merger. Bill becomes angry at the prospect of the company that he built becoming less than he planned, believing that a man should leave something of integrity in his passing, whereupon Joe cautions ""Easy, Bill; You'll give yourself a heart attack and ruin my vacation"".<br /><br />Realizing that Joe could end his delay at any time, Bill unprecedentedly arranges for dinner with his family two nights in a row, prompting them to be afraid. Bill attempts a broken and awkward speech focusing on the idea of family, after which he invites them all back for dinner again the next night. Touched by his feelings, they all agree, with one exception; that being Drew, who is angered by the presence of Joe Black, who appears to have taken the ear of Bill Parrish and disrupted Drew's plans. He is even more rankled by the increasing closeness between Susan and Joe. After a number of snide comments aimed at Joe over dinner, Drew confronts Susan about her feelings for Joe, which ends in Drew's uncertainty.<br /><br />After a flirtatious conversation with Joe, who has overheard the argument with Drew, Susan is warned by Bill not to become attached to this mysterious stranger. During the next day, Drew has gathered the board of the company, advising them that Parrish has been unconditionally influenced by ""Mr. Joe Black"" and telling them that the offer from the rival company will be accepted with or without Parrish as Chairman.<br /><br />After a scene wherein Parrish is reminded of the importance to himself of his family when he distresses his other daughter, Allison (Marcia Gay Harden), who is trying to organize Bill's sixty-fifth birthday party, he answers the door to Drew, who starkly threatens that the Board will see him removed from the Chair. Drew then leaves, angrily announcing to Susan that this is ""the end of my chapter with the Parrishes. And the end began with this guy"", indicating Joe, who has also followed. After a tense and crude standoff, Drew leaves Susan and Joe alone. They are interrupted by Bill, who shows concern for his daughter.<br /><br />The following morning, Parrish is confronted by Drew and the Board of Directors, who reiterate their intentions regarding the merger. After Bill's emphatic refusal to accept both the merger and the Board's request for the identity of Joe, they vote to make Bill ""Chairman Emeritus"", thus depriving him of power. After the meeting, it is revealed that Drew was in collaboration with the rival company with the intention of seizing power and then selling off Parrish Communications for a huge profit.<br /><br />Bill and Joe return home, where Bill, disheartened, goes for a nap. Joe comes across Susan; after an awkward moment, they make love. Afterwards, he meets with Bill, who defies this union and reminds Joe of his purpose in the universe. Joe disregards Bill's words.<br /><br />Shortly after another encounter with Bill's daughter, Joe realizes that she is not enamored exactly of him, but rather of the man whose body he has assumed. Joe returns to Bill, who tries to entrap Drew. Joe assists by claiming that he is an IRS agent investigating Drew's dealings; a play on the saying ""death and taxes"". Bill is restored as chairman and the merger is canceled.<br /><br />In his speech at the lavish gala celebration, Bill Parrish fondly expresses his appreciation to his daughters for their work preparing it as well as his love for both of them. Joe later escorts Bill out of sight over a nearby bridge, presumably to his own death. Joe then sends back to life the young man whose body he borrowed, allowing Susan that chance to pursue a relationship with him. Susan tells him she wishes he could have met her father, indicating that she understands (as hinted earlier) that Joe Black was Death, and that her father is dead. The story ends as both of them are watching the fireworks celebrating her father's birthday.<br /><br />Although the film's story and characters were praised highly, many critics felt that its three hour running time was excessive, and thus reaction became mixed, with one half of the critical spectrum branding it boring, and the other half claiming that its slow pace made the story more poignant.[1] The Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy and Horror Films nominated it for a Saturn Award in three categories - Best Actor, Best Supporting Actress and Best Music - the film was also nominated in the Worst Remake or Sequel category at the Razzie Awards. Gary Richied of the Westchester Gazette gave the movie a 4 star rating, citing the Academy Award deserving performances by Pitt and Hopkins. It also received positive reviews from Siskel and Ebert, who gave it ""Two Thumbs Up"", with Ebert adding ""there's so much that's fine in this movie"".[2]<br /><br />While the film had a disappointing domestic box office return of $44,619,100, it fared much better overseas. Taking in an additional $98,321,000, the movie grossed a worldwide total of $142,940,100.<br /><br />A two-hour version was made to show on television and airline flights, by cutting most of the plotline involving Hopkins' character's business. Brest derided this edit of his film and thus disowned it, so the director's credit was changed to the Hollywood pseudonym Alan Smithee.", 5.0

3892926,"In a world where we have movies titled Cowboys vs. Aliens, any horror movie takes on comedic overtones. In this case it's Cowboys vs. Molemen, but The Burrowers is so much more.<br /><br />The movie begins with a flashback to Irishman Fergus Coffey (Karl Geary) giving a silver brooch to his betrothed, Maryanne Stewart (Jocelin Donahue). Then comes the gut-punch of a family abducted by...something. To the director's credit, we don't see the somethings until well into the middle of the film.<br /><br />But The Burrowers is less interested in the creatures, who are interesting but not groundbreaking, and prefers instead to focus on the conflict between the American Indians and the Northern occupational forces. The ""good guys"" consist of our Coffey, former military officer John Clay (Clancy Brown), investigator William Parcher (William Mapother), and brings along the song of the woman he's courting.  After tagging along with a military train led by psychopathic Captain Henry Victor (Doug Hutchison), they pick up African-American cook Callaghan (Sean Patrick Thomas) and decide to venture out on their own in pursuit of the kidnappers.<br /><br />The kidnappers, of course, aren't the Indians but ancient beasts that paralyze their prey, bury it, and then eat them later. They are a byproduct of the war over the buffalo, which was their usual prey until the White man drove the buffalo to near extinction. All told, the monsters take up twenty minutes of the film.<br /><br />The rest of the story is the unpleasant realities of war between the whites and Indians.  The Whites make no distinction between Ute (the ""bad"" Indians) and the Sioux (the ""good' Indians). Military forces use torture on their Indian captives.  Indians bash the faces in of fallen foes.  And no one has any compunction about shooting a man's horse.  This isn't the Wild West of the movies.<br /><br />By the time the Burrowers are revealed, it's clear that humanity has inflicted far worse on each other. Sure, the Burrowers are disgusting, frightening, and predatory - but in comparison to the horrors of war, they're the lesser of two evils. The Burrowers ends on a nihilistic note, a welcome change from typical man vs. monster films. The fate of the protagonists is appropriately awful enough that it burrows into your brain long after the movie is over.", 4.0

638663,"1997?s fourth installment in the ?Aliens? movie franchise is my least favorite of the bunch for many reasons even though it also has it?s own merits. In all honesty, while there?s plenty of things to enjoy, this movie is missing something that made the first two movies so incredible and even the third one which has it?s own flaws of it?s own. <p> This movie takes place 200 years after the events of ?Alien 3?. Ellen Ripley?s DNA has been successfully recovered and a mix of Ripley and the alien?s DNA have been successfully cloned and now Ripley?s ?descendant?, actually a clone of her has been brought to life to wage her final battle against the predatory aliens that are now approaching the planet Earth. The ?new? Ripley has Alien DNA within her that makes her capable of ?caring? for the alien creatures. A band of vicious smugglers however comes on board to steal the Alien DNA only to discover that the new breed of aliens is more dangerous than any other ever before and now the aliens are hunting both ?Ripley? and the smugglers and now they must destroy the alien and prevent them from getting to Earth and also try to make it home alive. <p> This movie cuts both ways for me. While certainly not a bad movie overall, ?Alien Resurrection? suffers the most from serious flaws more than any of the previous ?Alien? movies. While the movie is enjoyable for its special effects and awesome action sequences, I for one agree with many that this was almost not even necessary to be made like this especially since the 1992 third entry was where it should?ve ended. A lot scenes are pretty gross to look at especially the ones where ?Ripley? tries to ?calm? down the alien creatures or even tries to act like some ?mother? figure to them. I for one feel that this movie is more of like some ?alternate timeline? movie spin-off of some sort that almost feels completely detached from the previous three and that it?s almost like thrown together leftovers from them as well.  <p> The cast is hit and miss for me. Sigourney Weaver as the ?new? Ellen Ripley is fantastic as usual and is the only one in my opinion who really carries this movie all the way through. Her character is still very good although a step or two down from the previous movies. The rest of the cast however really don?t fare anywhere near as good. Winona Ryder really drops the ball on this one and the character she plays is boring and without character or personality even though she isn?t as she is thought to be. The male cast comes off being excessively dry and unconvincing and one in particular is almost enough to tick you off at his attitude towards Ryder?s character in this movie. The directing by Jean-Pierre Jeunet is really good and this combined with Siguorney Weaver?s acting as usual really do a lot to make this flawed movie a good movie worth watching. <p> The movie has its merits though. The special effects are top-rate and the movie has a really suspenseful tone but it starts getting to the point that the formula has been a bit tried since it has already been done three times already. The newest species of alien is really scary and but the face and head look almost like a human skull or even a deformed Freddy Krueger. The movie is saved by a really awesome but gruesome ending which I?m not going to mention out of fear of spoiling it. The ending alone saves this movie along with the special effects. While many movie series seam to suffer from a pattern called the ?Fourth Installment Syndrome/Curse? or whatever you call it with examples like ?Batman and Robin? or ?Jaws: The Revenge?, ?Alien Resurrection? avoids a lot of this with great special effects and awesome sequences. For a ?Part 4? movie, this really fares so well for a fourth installment and maintains some freshness even if the cracks in the franchise start showing through. <p> The ?Director?s Cut? edition of ?Alien Resurrection? does little to improve this movie and is only like ten minutes longer than the original and of the revamped versions of all of the ?Alien? movies, ?Alien Resurrection? benefits the least out of them all and the result is disappointing. The movie also has a new intro to it. The second disc like the other films on their newest re-issues has lots of great extras with ?making of?, commentaries, and lots of cool Easter eggs. There are plenty of extras in this movie that are worth looking at though and the DVD is really excellent. The picture quality was good to begin with but this ?Collector?s Edition? really improves the picture quality and the sound quality is amazing to the point that if you have surround audio speakers or can connect your TV to the stereo speakers, then it will feel almost like you?re back at the big screen again! The final result for me is that this gets a rating that rounds off to 3 solid stars but at the same time, this movie while good on its own, just never can find it?s own place against the shadows of it?s predecessors and is ultimately a movie that is more for the die-hard Alien audiences. <p> Looking back on it now, I have to say that despite the weaknesses especially on the last two parts in the series, ?Aliens? stands as one of the best sci-fi/horror/action movie franchises of all time and that Sigourney Weaver may be the most remembered by her roles in all of them.", 4.0

4063765,"I recently watched the blue ray version of this movie with the expectation of the new horrow classic, but unfortunately it was a big disappointment. I hope this is not your introduction to the new horror genre because high tension, them, may, and inside are all far superior than this film (French horror is awesome). The movie spent alot of time setting up for the scenes in the cave and had some pointless story before they finally even got to the cave. It seemed like for over half the movie you are sitting there waiting for something to happen. It was so dull, luckilly I had my computer and was surfing the net. I also feel that creatures themselves looked like a knock-off of a sci-fi channel movie. They look like a combination of nosferatu with pirranha teeth.  If you see the movie for hot girls you may be happy, but don't expect much to get you to excited....i.e. no nudity.(A cardinal sin if hot girls are in horror movies) There were some scenes in the cave that were quite intense, but not enough. They should have had more scenes concerning the isolation and darkness of the large cave. They also should have created more suspense playing with the emotions of the audience. All the characters seemed to have light moving in the cave through the whole movie, and I believe that if some scenes in complete darkness would have been far more effective. Overall I feel this is no better than any of those straight to video horror movie.", 2.0

439363,"As you probably know, the &quot;Why We Fight&quot; series was produced by Frank Capra when he was a major in the U.S. Army Signal Corps. The series was commissioned by Army Chief of Staff, General George C. Marshall, as a way of indoctrinating all the troops who signed up in the wake of Pearl Harbor and the declaration of war. The idea was to make it clear we were doing more than just remembering Pearl Harbor. Eventually the series was shown to the public in theaters across the country. This introductory film in the &quot;Why We Fight&quot; series covers the events leading up to the Second World War, focusing on the rise of Fascism in Italy and Germany, the Japanese attacks on Manchuria, and the United States' lack of military preparedness. The last is particularly interesting because it implicitly explains Pearl Harbor not as a Japanese victory, but rather as an American defeat (we lost rather than they won). &quot;Prelude to War&quot; defines World War II in black and white terms as the totalitarian worldwide conspiracy threatens to turn the free world into a slave world. Admittedly a propaganda film, this 1942 documentary is quite informative, explaining about Hitler's book &quot;Mein Kampf,&quot; Lebensraum, the Tanaka Plan, the London Naval Treaty, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, the Nuremberg Laws, and even such details as the Roman fasces. <p>This 54-minute black &amp; white film won the Academy Award for best documentary in 1942 and the series as a whole is credited with redefining the documentary as an art form. Of great historical value, it must be underscored that &quot;Prelude to War&quot; is not exactly propaganda in the most pejorative sense of the term. The film's great &quot;sin&quot; along those lines is that it makes the case that public opinion was moving in the direction of joining the war. Instead of dismissing this film and Capra's efforts as the American counterpart to what Goebbels was doing in Nazi Germany, it is more accurate to think of it as being the film equivalent of a prosecutor's speech in a trial. &quot;Prelude to War&quot; makes much better use of evidence without the radical distortion you usually find in classic examples of propaganda.", 5.0

It was an extended video game commercial, and it clearly had very little to do with the real Dante and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LNOW3G"">The Divine Comedy</a>.  Amazingly enough, though, the film was still able to win me over with stunning, textured animation (NOT computer generated), fantastic voice talents, and a story and main character that both become surprisingly rich as the story moves forward.  I found it incredibly rewarding to watch a simple, two-dimensional hero come face to face with the accidental sins he'd been party to throughout his life and seek redemption and extreme self-sacrifice in the process.  It's exciting, shocking, and incredibly thoughtful -- much more than a shameless video game tie-in.  It also exhibits a decent understanding of Hell as Dante portrayed it, even though the plot is entirely original.<br /><br />All in all, this is a first rate effort, and it's the kind of anime classic that I'd be proud to put on the shelf next to <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00012QLQ4"">Akira</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6304493681"">Ghost in the Shell</a>, but I must warn parents that this is definitely not a film for kids and adolescents to watch.  Sex and nudity are excessive throughout, whether in portraying half naked corpses, naked lovers praying, or demon temptresses with highly detailed (and weaponized) genitalia.

1047101,"I remember seeing the posters for this one when my buddy and I were hanging out in Cali for the Weekend of Horrors horror con. I can't say I was thrilled at first when I hard the news although I had known it was just a matter of time before some schmuck saw reason to remake yet another cult film fave. I still was hellbent for election on seeing this film and even had hoped that I'd be able to catch it in the theaters. No such luck. I had to wait for DVD like everyone else but at least Walmart sells the standard DVD for $10 so who's complaining, right?<br /><br />If you've seen the original, you pretty much know what to expect here. If rape or brutality offends you, ISOYG isn't your movie. No other way to put it. This is not a Michael Bay film and I thank God for that. The film-makers here actually did their homework and delivered a very effective, if not powerful revenge flick which holds up well for repeated viewings and should satisfy most horror fans in the midst of things. Probability suggests I will grow to like this film even more with repeated viewings as there aren't any great horror films that I'm aware of anymore which are granted a major release.<br /><br />ISOYG is as brutal as they come but this is not an Eli Roth film as we have no sympathy for Jennifer Hill's victims. Well, maybe one. :-) Suffice to say, you are rooting for her all the way in the second half of the film as each lowlife is dispatched in the most gruesome fashion imaginable. Rest assured, she will have no mercy on any of them and will not back down until each one is punished severely.<br /><br />Definitely much more polished and professional than the seventies Grind house classic, the remake still manages to disturb it's viewer and doesn't let up. Whereas the original focused somewhat on the sexualized violence in our protagonist's revenge scheme, the modern day classic alleviates seduction altogether. Instead, Jennifer chooses to pit them against each other and takes her time to carry out the methodical revenge plan. Although we do not necessarily see how she escapes or her grand scheme of revenge, we are fully assured that justice will be served in the most bloody, cathartic sense of the word.<br /><br />What I found most disturbing about the revision is how her attackers torment the lead character as if we were watching Michael Haneke's Funny Games instead of your typical rape/revenge fare. I must confide that watching these men abuse Jennifer in every sense of the word before sexually assaulting her really took me out of my element and I couldn't but think of all the innocent women who have been raped through the years. Even a more hideous thought, they've been killed after being assaulted.<br /><br />Brave Sarah Butler. This is one role that really deserves the utmost praise and it's a shame we don't give Oscars for horror flicks very often. Camille Keaton is an awesome actress and I couldn't imagine anyone who could pull off this role but Sarah Butler is outstanding as Jennifer Hills. In fact, the supporting actors are very convincing as well which is a strong suit considering most of the cast in the original looked very wooden.<br /><br />Thumbs up sky high! It's hard to tell if the ISOYG is really just a fluke or if we can expect more great endeavors from the cast/crew but I'm definitely sold on this effort. As a long time horror fan and lover of films which address the male encroachment issue, this is one powerful piece of film-making. See it if you handle it!!", 4.0

4093097,"I must confess, I was not sure what to make of this movie.  First, you had Downey Jr. stepping into the role of the iconic sluth and second, well you had Downey Jr. stepping into the role of Sherlock Holmes.  On some levels it works, I mean let's face it, Downey is fun to watch and he has that quirky quality one must have to play the singular Holmes.  The real problem with this movie was not Downey, he was game as always, but the screenplay, I mean, the MASON'S AGAIN?!  I also found it hard to understand some of the dialogue, Downey spoke quickly and with his mock English accent, I had to hit the subtitle on the DVD menu.  This being a convaluted mystery, it was most important to understand, what was being said.  The story itself is interesting on some level, but no exactly original, frankly, at times I thought i was watching The League of Distinguished Gentlemen (for the record, not a movie I care see again).  The villian is well played and, to be honest, I wish I had seen a bit more of him.  Oh yes, don't let me forget Law, he was actually quite good as Watson, and I liked his banter with Downey Jr.  Overall, not a bad movie, Downey has potential as Sherlock, let's just hope in the sequel, he gets a screenwriter that can keep up with him.", 3.0
