review,prediction
"The check in staff were very friendly and could not do enough to help after we asked them to change the bedding as we were both allergic to feather duvets etc They had made a note on our last visit, and could not do enough to rectify once we told them they were still feather!",positive
The room was great - modern & clean. Robes & slippers were a welcome touch (superior room) The restaurant area had been refurbished and was very attractive. The breakfast was fabulous. The staff were friendly although there could have been more staff on duty on Saturday afternoon. A large hen party group was checking in and there was no porter on duty so to collect bags from the storage area took over 20 minutes.,negative
This is a great hotel. The staff are very friendly and professional and willing to help. The rooms have everything you need for a business traveler. The wifi is quick and I had no problem in streaming music and videos.,positive
The price of the room which we stayed in was Â£270 (without breakfast!!) I don't think it was worth that much as I have previously stayed at radisson hotels which have been a lot nicer and cheaper! Also the noise from the 6th floor is very bad especially being a Saturday night it kept us up throughout the night!,positive
The parking facilities are excellent but did find the charges a little steep but that's the only gripe I have and that's really nit picking for something.,negative
"I come to this hotel regularly and I find the ""superior"" bedrooms are getting a bit tired at the back of the hotel, the decor is a bit shabby now and needs an update, the better rooms are at the front with the view over the Headrow or the square out front. 
I also don't like the serving implements in the breakfast room, its a small thing but annoying!",positive
"Rooms starting to feel their age a little but still extremely functional and offer a great standard of accommodation. Breakfast price slightly on the high side, price closer to that of a 5 star hotel.",positive
The place was well located and we were very happy by its proximity to Trinity Mall and a major shopping complex. Everything in Leeds seemed so near. We just had to walk around mostly. Neat and tidy. The rooms were comfy. We had two double beds where three of us could comfortably sleep and the sheets were changed on a daily basis. Thanks.,negative
"Stayed here a few times and it can be a little noisy when on the main road side of the building having said that you are in the middle of a busy city.
Reception check in/out can be a little slow at busy times this is not the staffs fault its just there`s too few of them and they also have to deal with an obviously slow and over complicated computer system.",positive
Lovely beds and complimentary water in the room. Great choice at breakfast. Ice bucket in room and ice machines on different floors.,positive
Room is small for a family. has a parking arrangement with close by parking garage but still a bit of a walk with suitcases.,positive
I was very disappointed that there was no hot water in the room after 10am due to maintenance work being carried out but we were not advised of this until we complained that the shower was not working. There was no hot water until after we checked out,negative
"Great comfort, cleanliness and loved the swimming pool/ sauna and breakfast, would highly recommend and will stay here again.",positive
"The beds were so comfy! The hotel staff were really helpful. We were a group of about 20 and the staff on reception went out of their way to put us in rooms next to each other, etc. Breakfast was amazing! Location was perfect.",positive
Shower not up to current standards. Square in front of hotel drinkers gathering point. Very noisy.,negative
One small gripe- I asked for extra milk in room but didn't receive this,positive
"Really comfy beds, great location for shops. Only 5 min walk from train station. Nice reception",positive
"Comfy beds, professional approach from all staff and wonderful breakfast-especially the porridge",positive
"The parking situation was pretty nasty. You park at one of the city center parking lots and then get your ticket validated. I didn't know to drive to the hotel's courtyard first to drop off baggage (since we arrived too early to checkin), so ended up schlepping baggage to and from the offsite parking.",positive
Swimming pool was great and decently sized. But the elevator to it broke down so we had to walk outside to get access to it. The staff is actually pretty friendly and easy to work with. We didn't bother with the expensive on-site breakfast but the location was great for exploring Leeds.,positive
No wi-fi in rooms unless you sign up for marriott membership!!! This is 2017 for goodness sake -expected more from Marriott chain.,negative
Best hotel breakfast for years. Sensational hash browns!,positive
i like the hotel location because it's easy to find and not too far and the road is not hard to pull our luggage to the hotel. Many restaurands and shop surrounding around the hotel.,negative
I was disappointed with the breakfast. I expected the breakfast would have been done to order in this type of hotel instead of buffet style. The selection & ingredients were of good quality but everything was tepid which is a pet hate of mine.,negative
Was really nice hotel good location spa was lovely staff very friendly,positive
The WIFI wouldn't work and kept saying I needed to go down to speak to reception. In 2017 I would think the WIFI would be easy to access especially somewhere in the city centre,positive
"noisy with open window (airconditioner outlets on roof opposite), heavy smell of pledge or some other cleaning stuff in the reception area, fitness room, acoustics in breakfast area",negative
The Bacon at breakfast was decidedly odd. A little smoked salmon to go with the scrambled egg would have been nice. Showers over the bath are a bit 1970s.,positive
"Carol, the lady who cleared our table at breakfast was extremely helpful going out of her way to find information about Leeds. She is a star.",positive
The restaurant leaves a lot to be desired the Yorkshire pudding was appalling the main good the desert not cooked,positive
"Excellent menue food was well presented and delicious, breakfast was everything you could wish for and the staff were friendly and helpful.Bed very comfortable room service excellent and a 12 check out",negative
"Breakfast was adequate. The hot food had been out for a long while, and there was no chef for personal preferences.",positive
"Great breakfast range, very friendly staff and brilliantly located. Reduced overnight night in the NCO car park",positive
"More staff during 12pm check out. A few waiting to check out and a queue for storing luggage. Would have had breakfast, but was very expensive!",positive
We stayed in room 224 check in early evening so didn't notice until the following morning the air conditioning didn't work meaning we slept on to of the covers at a very unpleasant temperature also there was major queuing for the lifts down to reception on check out as only 2 of the 3 were working,negative
"Great location with great food and bar , minutes away from many of the cities facilities",positive
Hotel bathroom small and dated. Shower over bath could have been more powerful. No bathrobes.,positive
Bed was lovely and comfy and bathroom was fab INCLUDING the toilettries,negative
"Disappointing to be expected to pay for wifi in the hotel room .We were also surprised that for a queen deluxe double room we only had one pack of biscuits to share and two breakfast tea bags.Other similar hotels and B&B s have been much more generous .Free water was however, appreciated.",negative
Checking in at busy time one person on reception queues formed it took a while for an extra person to show up to help Checking in at busy time one person on reception queues formed it took a while for an extra person to show up to help,positive
The bed was very comfortable rooms clean and tidy the spa centre was well equipped. A very pleasant stay.,positive
Our room way so stuffy and hot. The air con wasn't cool enough and the windows didn't open wide enough. We left the window shut to enable the a/c but it was still too hot.,positive
"Great beds, excellent breakfast. Good city centre location although prone to street noise because of that.",positive
Front at front of hotel very noisy at 3am on a Sunday mornining. One lift out of order and no stairs,negative
"Unfortunately, the lift down to the gym was out of service which meant you needed to take the street entrance to the gym, it was raining outside so it wasn't particularly nice. The gym was smaller than I expected",negative
"Property was in the best locations for restaurant's and cocktail bars! And not too far from the shopping centre. Rooms are spacious. You have accessibility to tea, coffee And biscuits!",negative
Breakfast was limited.. pillows we not that comfortable..,negative
The proximity to the city centre was great! Lovely staff! And great rooms! Spacious and comfortable!!,positive
Parking at the hotel could have been explained better we would have used the valet parking if it had been explained to us,negative
Expensive for what we got. Very noisy from city at night and inconsiderate boy racers! Not enough tea and coffee and milk in room for 4. Fab breakfast and staff made up for it!!,positive
No stairs in the hotel which was annoying. We were on the 1st floor and had to constantly wait an age on the lift. Only fault,negative
Situated in a great area. Very convenient for what we needed it for. Leisure facilities were excellent apart from the jacuzzi being out of order at the time. Great staff and a very welcoming atmosphere. Some amazing bars and even better restaurants near by.,negative
"Staff were very friendly and helpful, pointing us in the right direction and drawing a map for us for our event that evening. Accommodation was gorgeous, clean and comfortable. Breakfast was tasty, everything you'd want.",negative
Staff every helpful and friendly! Good location in town! All around very pleased!,positive
"Main restaurant was very pricey, considering there were so many other dining options and competitors in town which was a few minutes walk. We would have liked to have eaten at the hotel for convenience as we were tired after our journey. We choose to eat elsewhere at another steakhouse due to cost.",negative
bank of air cond. units very noisy on roof of annexe opp room 612 affecting our enjoyment dining room to cold,negative
"The rooms took a long time to cool down. It was my hen do and hotel staff were aware, A complimentary bottle of wine would have completed the experience.",positive
having to pay for parking. Hot tub was out of order during my stay.,negative
The breakfast was expensive and not worth the price that would be my only negative about the stay as everything else was lovely and enjoyable,positive
Friendly staff and a very comfy stay and the rooms fairly priced. Would love to go and stay again to use more of the Hotels facilities as my stay was short but all other services I received was 10/10. Many thanks for a fantastic stay.,negative
Lovely rooms but lots of noise from ours loud music think it was from nite club further down so we didn't get much sleep,positive
"didnt like that baby swim lessons wwere being held in the pool in the morning, our swim was spoilt with instructor singing baby songs very loud and lots of shouting and spalshing , we had to check out at lunch time and would have enjoyed much better a nice relaxing swim, maybe lessons can be in afternoon to allow guests to enjoy peaceful swim before they have to check out .",positive
"Very clean hotel, centrally located with friendly staff",negative
Great location close to all the lively pubs and clubsðð»,positive
Breakfast good and good to know you can still get a free brekky even in the exec room on a Saturday morning. Well Paul concierge he was very helpful,positive
"The wifi was quite rubbish to be honest, poor connection. Apart from that Everthing was Great",negative
"The room I stayed in was very spacious,clean and the bed was lovely to sleep in! The location was excellent within walking distance to all the bars I wanted to visit. If I ever visit Leeds again i would definitely stay at this hotel :-)",positive
Room was lovely although we ended up with twin beds because they said the hotel was full. I Said we booked a deluxe queen . They said that's a preference,negative
Excellent location (we were visiting the University) and friendly staff. Room was a v good size and soundproofed so didn't hear outside traffic.,negative
Prices fluctuate too much from one week to another! Sometimes it s 100Â£ other times 200Â£ for the same room.,positive
"Breakfast cost extra (Â£17.50 for full menu !) and slow to come. Ordered taxi took an age to come, wasn't too clear about destination (Leeds University main entrance, for heaven's sake) leaving us anxious about missing our engagement.",positive
We asked for an extra blanket that came straight away. Room heating was simple and effective. Staff were universally cheerful and helpful.,positive
Had a room at the front of the hotel overlooking the entrance. For some reason a car continued to use the horn until around 4am. I accept the hotelcan do nothing about this. It it spoiled my stay.,negative
The rooms were lovely and the location very handy!,negative
"Location for the town, having two double beds instead of a put me up, the valet service for the car.",negative
The heat in the hotel was too hot. Wi-Fi was not free as it is in lower budget hotels. There was a sanitary towel floating in the small pool!!,positive
"Excellent breakfast. Everything fresh and piping hot. Friendly staff in dining room. Complimentary wine and strawberries delivered on arrival to celebrate our anniversary. Very clean room. Lovely atmosphere in bar, restaurant and reception areas. Great views. Easy access to train station.",positive
The hotel has no car park. they recommend you use trinity car park nearby which is actually only about 200m away. Trinity car park did have on site security who I understand are there until about 2am. The hotel will stamp your ticket to discount the carparking charge.,negative
"On the first floor above the bar. A bit noisy, but went quiet just after midnight.",negative
"Good response to requests,also car park deal a good reason to stay in such a central location.",positive
Great size room and amazingly comfy bed! Great facilities around the hotel and friendly staff! Perfect Location!,positive
Lots of noise at night outside I was on the 6th floor at the front of the building due to the court yard and a lively crowd outside it was noisy late into the night.,negative
The breakfast choice was very poor no bacon left mushroom tasted like tin muchrooms! The continental was a poor choice too .... very disappointed,negative
Gorgeous hotel it's location allows for it to be quiet even though it's in the middle of the city centre. Staff were extremely friendly and polite. Concierge desk could not have been more helpful with taxi's etc. Beds were warm comfortable. Extremely grateful for the in room temperature control as it was consistently 0 degrees or below outside during our stay. Perfect city centre location. Overall an excellent stay.,negative
"Tried to pay by credit card over the phone before arrival and had to submit a form by email first which was meant to be for my security, I think this is less secure as my details are now on a hard copy and a lot of messing about when details could just have been taken via phone.",negative
Staff on reception really friendly and very quick checkin and out. The room was spacious with comfortable bed and pillows.,positive
Noise from square outside - contractors not associated with hotel,negative
"The gym might not be a main facility used but it felt small, it was a little uncomfortable where the weights was especially if more than 2 people were in that area. The room had a slightly odd smell which might be why the windows of my room were left wide open yet the curtains closed - not something which I would want when leaving the room with valuables in, however, due to the curtains being closed I didn't realise until later on when the traffic noise was getting louder. The bathroom could do with being updated but was comfortable enough.",negative
Aircon in the room did not work. I got an electrical heater to worm up the room. This heater helped but was not solving the issue,negative
I had room service and it was very efficient with a good standard of food. As a sole female guest I liked that they sent it with female staff. I was on business and the facilities I the room meant that I could do my work.,negative
The bedroom and bathroom were a little dated. The noise from the bar was loud until the early hours even though we were three floors up,negative
"Bed was comfortable, the staff on reception (we dealt with 3) were all excellent, as was the breakfast.",negative
"The spa is in a bad way, dirty floors and the water drinking tank is rusting away. The changing rooms were filthy loads of people complaining. If you didn't visit the spa everywhere else is of a high standard and very clean but the spa area needs some work",positive
"Our initial check in was a bit rough without going into too much detail we were told to park in the wrong car park, we were then told there was only one room when we had booked two & when that was resolved the rooms were on different floors which was unacceptable as we had 2 14 year olds with us. Once we got sorted we had a lovely time but it wasn't a v good start.",positive
"Fantastic breakfast and location was perfect right in the city centre next to all the shops, restaurants and bars!",positive
Swimming pool wasn't open which was very disappointing,negative
We were not advised that we had to get the car park ticket stamped in order to receive discount.,positive
The bed was very comfy and location was excellent. Staff were all very friendly.,negative
We didn't have a fridge in the room which were fairly disappointing as we'd took a few drinks to enjoy before going out to celebrate new year.,positive
"The staff were lovely and enjoyed the bar on New Year's Eve before we left, bar staff great an lovely atmosphere.",positive
Staff very helpful and friendly . Enjoyed the leisure facilities.,positive
Use of the hotel pool was one of the reasons we booked this property and it was sadly out of action during our trip.,positive
Room was like an office very hard looking furniture and very dark,negative
Being given a disabled room with no bath when we had booked a queen suite.,negative
"The bed was really uncomfortable, my room door kept opening and not closing properly due to the wind so had to put my trainers against the door to stop it opening. The bathroom was hurrendous, came back from my night in the town and the toilet had 4 fag ends at the bottom in the water and weren't there when I used it in the sfternoon.",positive
"Everything. There was no wifi and when u ran up extra data after your normal bill, everything I said in the last question was questionable, got to the accommodation the kind taxi driver waited for me to get an answer from the owners who I had to ring to come and collect me and take me to my room, had to ask the right questions to get answers from them.",negative
"No breakfast as stated which a paid more for!!, no tea and coffee as stated no where to lock up valuables and privacy was a curtain made with a mop and pegs couldn't wait to get out of there, plus the woman who met me there didn't have a clue what I was saying to her!!",positive
"It was absolutely filthy, I am not a light hearted person. It should be illegal to charge people Â£45 for a night in that filthy place, I feel I have been robbed!!!. Very disappointed and next time I will think twice to use the booking.com.",negative
I was booked in for a double bed in the shared dormitory but did not get one as it was just a bunk bed.The room was very cramped for space with no lounge which I was expecting as it was a guest house.The sides of the bath had a lot of black mould on which is not good.It is not a place where you can spend much time in what with the limited space.Also there is no name up or even correct number of the guest house so difficult to find and you cannot check in until 18.oo which is a lot later than every other accommodation I have been to over all the years ,positive
Staff did not speak English. Room and bathroom filthy with full room bin from previous occupier. Bed sheets and floor dirty. Staff planned to leave before to final check in time given on email and made me feel guilty for making them stay until that time. No key given to property so cannot leave and re-enter without arranging for cleaner to be there. Heard rat/mouse during the night. Walls paper thin. Room cold. Taxi driver told me he would wait until I found the property from the car park (difficult to find) because the area was known to be unsafe.,negative
"The room was right outside the kitchen, anyone could walk into the room and go through to the kitchen, also anyone could walk through the room at anytime to go out the back door. This made me uncomfortable and I had a sleepless night, with people walking in and out. Only privacy was a curtain around the bed, felt like I was a girl in the taken film being trafficked Shower was luke warm and light pressure The house itself was very cluttered and dirty, needs a good clean and clear out",negative
"There was nothing to like because there was no guest house to speak of at the address indicated. No number on the door, nobody on the phone when i called when i was around the place. This is a scam as far as I am concerned. Avoid at all cost.",negative
Nothing staff are rude and tried charging extra money saying booking.com only collect part paymentwhen not the case,negative
"The unit was inside a private residential area has a private access leading to the city centre. It takes about 10-15 minute walk to city centre, very convenient. The unit is very bright, clean, homely and the beds are comfortable. It has almost everything in the kitchen and sitting area you need for holiday. The shower is strong and the bathroom is spacious. Nick is a good host. He has prepared a basket of food with apples and banana, chocolates, tea bags... We enjoy our stay there and it is of excellent value of money.",negative
"Great location, very well finished apartment with great views of the city. Nick was very quick to reply to any questions and collecting the keys was really easy. I would definitely recommend this apartment an stay here again.",positive
The apartment was modern and comfortable. Great proximity to the city.,positive
"It was modern and was like a home from home, it had everything you would need and the beds were very comfortable.the kitchen was very well equipped and having a dishwasher was a great bonus",positive
The apartment was home from home and very beautiful and comfortable. Excellent value for money,negative
Beds were very comfortable flat was spotless a real home from home,positive
"The welcome pack, the instructions from the car park to get to the flat were fantastic!! The ease of picking keys up to getting to the flat was great and totally stress free.",positive
"The apartment was in a great location - really central and a good walking distance into the centre. It was clean and modern, and a really lovely apartment to stay in.",positive
"The only 1 thing I would have liked was a later check out. 11am is a little early, but I guess that's quite standard across most hotels/apartments",positive
Place was clean and tidy and comfortable beds with a good view,positive
Maybe some information in the apartment on what  areas in the city centre for nice bars & restaurants. Possibly a map of where to find the decent establishments. We were only there for two days & having never been before we found our first day a bit hit & miss !,positive
"The apartment  was very well presented with everything you need for a few days stay.
The Welcome pack was greatly appreciated.
The owner meeting us at the property with the keys was a nice welcome & made it easier than having to collect the keys from elsewhere !
There was plenty of choice for SHOPPING,MUSEUMS etc.",positive
The apartment was absolutely beautiful and very clean. The hosts John and Nick were available on telephone and were very helpful. Parking for 1 car was available in the basement. This was very useful. They had left a lovely welcome fruit basket with some chocolate and biscuits.,positive
"Excellent stay. Room was very comfortable and clean, the facilities were very good and the welcome pack was a great extra touch. We really enjoyed our stay",positive
"The property was fully equipped and only a 10 min walk from the train station.  The apartment was extremely clean and the welcome basket with teas, coffees and fruits was a lovely touch. ",negative
The property was clean and well insulated so no noise.,positive
Very good location. Excellent facilities. Stayed here with 4 friends and had a blast! We have booked to return very soon!,positive
Rooms not worth the cost. Towels and bath robes seem old and tired. Mini bar was empty with a sign on saying call reception if want it filled! I've never known that happen before.,negative
"Reveption staff, location, room service, nice entrance.",positive
Staff were very understanding and moved us to a quieter room after being up all night due to loud noise of children shouting and banging doors,negative
"The hotel on the whole is beautiful. Staff is very attentive and can answer all questions. Location is perfect for shopping, restaurants & pubs. There is a gorgeous indoor pool.",positive
The bath and shower water not very hot bath ran really slow,positive

Very clean. Staff very friendly. Walking distance to town centre,positive
The breakfast was great and the accommodation was as expected. Staff were friendly and dealt with any issues immediately. Fab location for train station and shopping areas and dining in the hotel was also a very pleasant experience,positive
The facilities were exactly what we needed,positive
"Room could have been a little cleaner - there was a large sticky stain left on the top of one of the bedside cabinets and the water pressure in the shower could have been a little better, but other than this, very happy.",negative
"Room was spacious and bed was comfortable. All staff were very polite, efficient and friendly. Good value for money.",negative

"Very friendly staff, especially when I needed to move rooms",negative
"The staff make this a very relaxed hotel. They are helpful and accommodating. I wasn't informed until confirmation of my booking that they were having a major refurb. This was kept to a minimum, although there was additional noise during the day. All in all though, it didn't spoil our stay.",positive
The cooked breakfast was very good.,positive
"Refurbishment on arrival booked months in advance got told about it 3 days before arrival, no conditioner with bathroom condiments.",positive
"The bedrooms are undergoing refurbishment which is a good thing as our was clean and comfortable but a little tired looking. However the price was good! The ladies shower area and toilets for the pool were basic and very tired looking (thankfully the showers themselves were powerful with lots of hot water). The steam room also looked quite tired with the tiled edges of the seats looking very worn. The breakfast was not great, sausages overcooked and dry and the bacon cold. Probably because they were using stoves/ heaters to keep things warm. I'm sure if I'd mentioned it they would have done something and hopefully when breakfast is provided in the refurbished restaurant these problems will disappear. However at Â£10 for 2 people the breakfast price was really good and other breakfast items (hash browns, fruit etc were plentiful and fine).",positive
"The bed was comfortable and the heating fully adjustable to our requirements. The staff were great particularly Alex on reception who was very welcoming and helpful with a ready smile. Edna the waitress was also very friendly and helpful too. The showers in the pool area were hot and powerful, very nice after a long swim. We really enjoyed the pool and that we were able to stay as long as we wanted after check out to take advantage of it.",positive
The heating in our firsts room was not working. So the staff moved us to a second room witch there was know fridge. Witch was not great as I had my to grandson under four to keepthere drinks in . And again the heating was not working the next morning. We would have stayed a bit long and used the pool. but because there was no heating in the room we just checked out as soon as we had breakfast.,positive
"Central location, good breakfast choice, adequate gym.",positive
Staff were friendly and very helpful. The pool facilities were great,positive
Refurbishment was being undertaken and we were not advised of this before booking. Work commenced before suggested time in the morning.,negative
I was charged for 4 breakfasts instead of one... It took a little argueing to put things right. Other wise everything was great.,positive
"There was a little noise as the hotel are undergoing refurbishments. This didn't wake us up as it started at 10am, but we didn't realize until we had made it to our room.",positive
"We loved the facilities, however the jacuzzi was closed on a Friday night which was a shame. Other than that we really enjoyed our stay and thought it was good value for money.",negative
"The availability for spa treatments was narrow and didn't allow for early or late treatment outside of working hours. The pool and hot tub were under renovation, which is the reason I picked the hote.",negative
The air conditioning wasn't working and the room was incredibly hot.,positive
"Lovely clean spacious room, bed was very comfy, breakfast was great and staff are very friendly",positive
"Room clean and functional, bed comfy. Service friendly and helpful. 10 min walk into town",negative
The room & breakfast were great. We were informed of a refurbishment before our arrival. This did not impact on our stay and would go again,positive
The free lemon water and the bar. The cleaner was lovely.rooms cleaned beautifully.,negative
My only critic and it might seem minor but I feel important. I had a cooked breakfast which was fine. But I like a little brown sauce and when I picked up the bottle the top and surround was full of tired and dried brown sauce which showed that it hadn`t been wiped or cleaned for a few days. A small point but attention to detail is important for such a class of hotel.,negative
Staff ere extremely helpful and very friendly. The location was central to our stay which made the trip easy going.,positive
Distance from station and shops not as stated on booking .com. Quite a long walk with case.  Got a taxi back.,positive
Breakfast very good. Staff friendly and helpful. Nice comfy room and bathroom. Food in bar good as was staff.,positive
The hot breakfast was shocking !! Already sent an email to you regarding it!,negative
"Bed was really comfy, reception staff were friendly and welcoming, facilities of the pool and spa was excellent!",negative
Pillows were lumpy and beds were on the small side. Shower runs off the taps so not a lot of pressure. Not happy car parking was Â£15 extra!,positive
If the general decor and repair of the room was updated and parking was free to all customers then this hotel would be the perfect place to stay.,negative
Very impressed with the excellent breakfast. The staff were all very friendly and helpful too. Room with two double beds is absolutely great for families. Comfortable beds and peaceful sleep. Many thanks to the hotel.,negative
"Jacuzzi was really cold. The breakfast was disgusting for the price we paid small frozen sausages which were vile chopped up hard black pudding, cheap frozen hash browns luke warm beans and eggs. We stopped off at services on the way home as everyone was hungry. Also I found the parking charge of Â£15 a little steep",positive
Breakfast very good and plenty to chose from also leisure facilities very good,positive
The bath wasn't as clean as i would have liked and the towel rail was loose. I felt the bar lacked any atmosphere as it seemed sparse.,negative
We loved the size of the room and the comfy beds. The leisure facilities and spa were great too. Check in was simple and the reception staff were friendly,positive
Leisure facilities too small for size of hotel food at hotel was nice but really over priced,positive
Nothing I didn't like basic/average room but for the price good,negative

"Friendly staff, really helpful. Hotel 5 mins from the train station, 10 minute walk into city centre, also has parking facilities.",negative
"The room was fitted with a desk, obviously for business use. My wife would have preferred a dressing table with mirror for hair drying etc.",positive
Large rooms with all amenities you need Efficient friendly staff,negative
"Staff at the bar at night time were absolutely miserable and no personality, also at breakfast me and my husband were waiting a good 15 minutes before we got a tea/coffee however another resident got asked straight away as he was a businessman so he got preferable treatment by the manager and even then we had to get his attention to ask for a drink.",negative
"It was my husbands birthday so we got upgraded for free, reception staff lovely and the guy in the gym/pool reception was lovely.",negative
"The room was clean and comfy, thought the restaurant was a little expensive.",negative
"Slight walk from centre, staff at breakfast were great but there really wasn't enough of them and they were rushed off their feet. Self service tea and coffee would have made this better",positive

"Good solid hotel building ...spacious bedrooms ..with nice modern bathrooms with bath and shower (modern trend is for hotels to move away from baths and provide showers only ,,,,most people like baths).......good sized reception...restaurant and bar....some lounge area also....breakfast had good varied content.....pool good for early swim opens6.30am",positive
"Excellent facilities, staff were extremely pleasant, we plan to return for definite.",negative
The sofa bed was not what I was expecting as I had booked two single beds. This was a little bit of a let down but would not stop me from booking again. I tried to book direct with you but was unable to so had to go through Booking .com.,positive
Staff were very helpful. Good deal for a Friday night stay. Pool is great,positive
Problem with the room we booked on booking.com - it was not available. However very friendly & efficient staff sorted out another room for us.,positive

The food was great and very affordable! The staff were all friendly and the rooms were comfortable and spacious.,positive
Had asked for 2 single beds when got there in morning room was not ready was told they had room with 2 beds when went to check in was told no rooms with 2 beds were available had to make with do with sofa bed not first time it has happened to me when booking with booking.com,positive
